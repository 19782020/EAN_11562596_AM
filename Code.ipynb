This has been estimated to al., 2018). Nitrogen oxide emissions from ships are regulated NOxreduction. The introduction of the automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS), long-range identiﬁcation and tracking (LRIT), and vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) have enabled tracking of individual ships in unprecedented detail. These navigational local and global scales. Currently, ship emission models using AIS data as an ac- tivity source are most popular. They can have accurate infor- models. Ship emission data are available on a global grid new routes in the Arctic. and departure following the same AIS-based approach as for at berth are estimated based on ship type and size, but with to comply with at least three options. The ﬁrst of these is fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment systems, which are commonly used (estuaries, ports) or water exchange is slow (e.g. the Baltic Sea) (Teuchies et al., 2020). The use of low-sulfur or LNG fuels is a fossil-based solu- tion, unless the fuel was made using renewable or fully syn- much on the engine type selected. Methane, methanol, and ammonia are three fuels which three fuels are also suitable for use in internal combustion engines as well as fuel cells. All three are hydrogen carri- els and have hydrogen production as an intermediary step.

In addition, the health impacts of PM are related to the isms. Commonly, it is challenging to decipher such effects in terms of each other. The factors may also have either syner- impacts of various PM properties are also known to be phys- In summary, there are many associations of various PM of these inter-dependencies are known relatively better, either qualitatively or quantitatively, while there are also numerous associations, which are currently known poorly. (iii) Research recommendations for deciphering the impacts of various particulate matter properties which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. et al. (2018) reported that there is a severe lack of epidemi- ological studies investigating the health impacts originating they pointed out that there is no clear distinction between PM thus, there is a limited number of studies assessing the re- spective health impacts. portance of the more advanced measures (in addition to PMmass fractions) are to some extent inconclusive. One reason for this uncertainty is that there are so many associations of pact of PM is the associated oxidative stress when the parti- cles are inhaled (e.g. see Gao et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). A possible explanation for the health effects from PM is based (Gao et al., 2020). One prominent emerging area is the evaluation of long- term, multi-decadal concentrations and meteorology on a sufﬁcient spatial resolution. Long-term and lifetime expo- sures are known to be more important in terms of human health, compared with short-term exposures. Comprehensive data sets are therefore needed, which will include multi- sets have already been reported (Kukkonen et al., 2018; Sid- et al., 2020; Siddika et al., 2020).

To analyse these questions, two methodologies have been de- veloped: cost–effectiveness analyses and cost–beneﬁt analy- ses.

Sim- strategies, the changes are not assessed or monetized. An exception is the UK, where estimations of the “social costs of carbon” are used in assessments (Watkiss and Down- ommends using a carbon price of GBP 69 per tonne of CO 2;eq at 2018 prices. emissions be monetized? A possibility is to use the same ap- proach as with air pollution; i.e. estimate the marginal dam- does not lead to useful results. Uncertainties are too high and timation of impacts. An alternative approach to estimating marginal damage costs is to use marginal abatement costs. A basic law of envi- ronmental economics is that for pollution control a pareto- age costs (MDCs) are equal to marginal abatement costs (MACs). Thus, if MAC at the pareto-optimal state are known, they could be used instead of the MDCs. However, the pareto-optimal state is not known if MDCs are not known. But one could use an environmental aim that is universally optimal solution in the view of society and then estimate the MACs to reach this aim, which is then used for the assess- ment. This approach was ﬁrst proposed by Baumol and Oates (1971). so-called Paris Agreement, which was agreed on at the 2015 by a large number of countries, the most important aim was could be used as the basis for generating MACs. Bachmann (2020) has carried out a literature research of MDCs and MACs for GHG emissions. Based on this review, are used here as the basis for the calculation of marginal of 3 % a\u00001, social costs of CO 2;eqto be used in 2020 would climate protection is foreseen, a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants is foreseen; thus, taking both air pollution con- prove the efﬁciency of such measures. are different from the ranking in separate plans is shown in by transport in the EU have been assessed with an integrated assessment.

Secondly, the marginal avoidance costs per tonne of avoided carbon are re- duced, especially for the period 2020–2035. The reason is later more expensive measures like producing and using fu- els that are produced from renewable electricity (power to X) will have a lower effect on air pollution reduction. In the following an example is shown where an efﬁcient cli-mate protection measure gets inefﬁcient if air pollution is in- cluded in the assessment. This example is the use of small wood ﬁrings in cities. Wood ﬁrings are climate friendly but that for wood ﬁrings that are operated in cities, the damage of gas emissions.

There are of course cross-cutting needs that are a prerequisite to further air quality research and de- dations for further research. There is a progressively important need to move from static annual inventories to those that are dynamic in terms of activ- ity patterns and of higher temporal resolution. This is driven and because there is an increasing availability of online ob- munity efforts are necessary for identifying and reducing un- certainties in emissions that have a large impact on the result- from source apportionment methods. One gap is the evaluation of agricultural emissions, which are still poorly understood, and improvements will support co-beneﬁts. While considerable effort has been devoted to es- timating NO xemissions, there are still uncertainties in the es- timation of VOC emissions. These uncertainties have direct contributions from secondary organic aerosols to regional ties is the estimation of VOC proﬁles in terms of the chemi- a shift has occurred to both low-sulfur and carbon-neutral or non-carbon fuels. airborne non-exhaust emissions is becoming more and more cles.

The worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has raised global interest anisms are not yet clear and require concerted effort (e.g. Pisoni and Van Dingenen, 2020). There is also evidence that is also becoming clearer, where dynamic diurnal activity pat- macher et al. (2019), for example, has also demonstrated the importance of the movements of people to assess exposure. which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. 10.6 Air quality management and policy Integrated assessment of air pollution control policies has progressively developed over the last 2 decades and has been widely used as a tool for air quality management (e.g. EC, lution control in research projects has started to take account of climate change. Correspondingly, integrated assessment activities for climate protection have started to include im- ergy and Industrial Strategy, have also recommended an inte- 2019). Impact pathway approaches are also currently increas- Friedrich, 2019). This has an implication for epidemiologi- cal studies, which usually are based on correlation betweenmodelled or measured concentrations at outdoor locations Interdependence of air pollution and climatically active also shows that costs of meeting policy obligations for cli- eﬁts of reduced climate change are much smaller than the impacts caused by increased air pollution. This has been Some recent studies (e.g. Schmid et al., 2019) have provided evidence on the advantages of using costs and beneﬁts for grated assessments. fuel for ships has been reduced to 0.5 % worldwide (IMO, 2019). The EURO 6d norm has led to a signiﬁcant reduction Council has recently (in September 2020) agreed to reduce fossil fuels. However, there is one exception: small wood (e.g. Kukkonen et al., 2020b). While direct combustion emissions are expected to de- eas that pose challenges for air quality management are the (especially ammonium nitrates). Using personal exposure instead of outdoor concentration portunity to assess the impacts of indoor air pollution con- should be assessed.

Further studies have supported the role and for the ﬁrst time particulate matter was included in aninternational protocol (Reis et al. 2012 ). 1999, it was realised that for some pollutants under the AirConvention, emission control needed to be considered over alone. Ozone was of particular importance, since long-termobjectives in the form of critical levels and public health Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) was set upunder the Convention in 2004, with a primary objective to quantify the intercontinental transport of pollutants.

SLCPs thus also includecompounds that are cooling the atmosphere, i.e. small secondary aerosols, e.g. sulphate particles. Recent research has focused on a better understanding of these compounds’contribution to both air pollution and climate as well as on Sand et al. 2016 ).

Around 2006 several initiatives were takenin Europe, including a special task force on Reactive was considered both as a traditional atmospheric pollutant molecular nitrogen again, was introduced (Galloway et al.2003 ). The studies have pointed to the importance of the driver, and monitoring programmes were set up both in the National Atmospheric Deposition programme (NADP) started in 1976 and is still running. Both countries have taken part in the Air Convention activities and have signedmost of the protocols and achieved decreases in SO 2 emissions of the order of 80% between 1980 and 2015. TheUS has however taken a different approach with respect topolicy in comparison to Europe.

The original EMEP network has since the start system. The originally established simple monitoring sta- tions have over time been complemented with moreadvanced monitoring, and some stations are today advanced atmospheric chemistry platforms with continuous collection of a multitude of atmospheric parameters (Fig. 6). The EMEP database is nowadays widely used for modelling. EMEP has also become a model for monitoring networks related to other geographical regions, conven-tions, and purposes. One example is the acid deposition monitoring network in East Asia (EANET).

Forming science–policy credibility crucially important to maintain scientiﬁc credibility. The close involvement of scientists has been a signature of the Air Convention. Scientists have always had a role at thepolicy meetings, communicating results from basic scien- a way that has been understandable and useful for thepolicy work. The role of the scientists has been as honest and observations of new problems have also been impor- tant, and have resulted in repeated changes in the framingsof the Air Convention to adapt to new situations: going interplay between the two communities has in this waybeen developed and maintained over time. Another factor is the building of networks. The strong during these four decades of the Convention is built on emissions in a cost-effective way. FUTURE CHALLENGES New approaches necessary International air pollution control is by many considered as a success story. However, the success is in many ways and development /C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en 123Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 859 industrialised countries (including Japan and Australia), where emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, VOCs, and some other compounds have been decreasedsigniﬁcantly (Maas and Grennfelt 2016 ). But even in the areas, where air pollution has been a top priority for several decades, air pollution remains a problem. Ecosystemeffects, which were the main reason for the establishment of the Convention, are to some extent reduced, but the emissions of ammonia have so far only been reduced by20–30% in Europe and even less in North America. Looking at health effects, it is difﬁcult to talk about suc- cess, when hundreds of thousands of inhabitants on bothcontinents are predicted to meet an earlier death due to air pollution. But the problem is even larger and more urgent when looking outside the traditional industrialised world. The focus is today on the large urban regions in the countries that are facing rapid population growth and industrialisation.Although large efforts now are being made to decrease sul- phur emissions in China—the world’s leading sulphur emitter—major challenges remain. In India and several othercountries, sulphur emissions are still increasing. Estimates airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/ ). It is assumed that ﬁne particles (PM2.5) are a main cause for the health effects. The new and great challenge is therefore to control air pol-lution in relation to health risks, in particular by decreasing exposure to the small particles. There is, however, a risk that control measures will only concentrations of particles have occurred during recentyears. At ﬁrst, these episodes were considered to be caused essentially by local emissions. More thorough analysis has, however, shown that they were to a large extent caused byregional emissions and buildup of high concentrations over Similar situations are also often encountered in urban are, as previously mentioned, also linked to interconti- nental and hemispheric scales. It is also obvious that the research communities within together. Health aspects are of importance both from airpollution and climate change perspectives, and heat wavescarry poor air quality as winds are often very low and the atmospheric boundary layer stagnant. During heat waves, and impacts on radiation balances. Modelling is a scientiﬁcarea where much progress has been made and where has allowed integration of atmospheric chemistry into theclimate models formulated as Earth system models, cou- simultaneously. The modelling approach can be further developed when observations are designed to map Earthsystem component boundaries to understand and quantify the ﬂows and interactions between different compartments, global-scale concepts such as ‘‘planetary boundaries’’ and ‘‘trajectories of the Earth system vs. planetary thresholds’’have been developed (Rockstro ¨m et al. 2009 ; Steffen et al. 2018 ). Solutions are available; driving forces and investments are lacking In 2016, the Air Convention launched a scientiﬁc report situation within the UNECE region was updated (Maas andGrennfelt 2016 ). The report also presented future chal- lems. It also showed that solutions are available for most ofthe identiﬁed problems at affordable costs below the health and ecosystem beneﬁts of the control actions. Even if solutions are available, many parts of the world are facing large problems in implementing them. There are several reasons, but often there is a lack of knowledge and resources. This is particularly true in many developingcountries. Another reason is the lack of political interest. Air pollution is still not of top priority among politicians, even if there is overwhelming evidence that air pollution isone of the most common causes of shortened life (e.g., industry and agriculture) are forming strong lobbyingforces delaying actions. 123/C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en860 Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 Air pollution is a problem that cannot be seen in isola- will be a win–win solution.

Policy development is no longer limited ten cause of premature deaths in the world has given high Additional initiatives are taken by other organisations, suchas the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the weather and climate observations, research and services, and it is rapidly developing its regional and global capac-ities in Earth system observations, modelling, and predic- threats and for global use. The research is done in largeprogrammes like Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) and if the starting point and modes of action can be different,all initiatives are aiming for the same goal, cleaner air. It is tional Law Commission, under which a proposal for a Lawfor the Protection of the Atmosphere has been prepared (http://legal.un.org/ilc/summaries/8_8.shtml ) but in the current international atmosphere there is a lack of politicalsupport to implement it. Our hope is that the situation will change soon—the initiative is too important to fail. The UN has put forward a very strong agenda in order to pollution is an integral part of several of the SGDs, like water. Climate change is a very signiﬁcant common and cross-cutting factor. The Air Convention has taken some steps in promoting well-developed structure, it has taken a role of making surethat international organisations having air pollution on its agenda are aware of each other and to invite to further collaboration and development. Initiatives are taken bothwithin the formal Convention structure and through dedi- which has proven successful in linking scientiﬁc evidence, monitoring, and integrated assessment modelling directed These new international initiatives have a strong emphasis on policy development. The experience from the50 years of international air pollution development is the value of well-deﬁned scientiﬁc objectives and activities supporting policy. The increased interest from WHO andUN Environment is welcome and there are expectations of situation in many parts of the world. However, for theseorganisations, air pollution is just one of several priority organisations are likely able to set up advanced infras-tructures with respect to emission inventories, monitoring, and its components, air pollution being an important part.This is in line with the WMO strategic plan and with fast tres like The European Centre for Medium Range WeatherForecast (ECMWF).

Financial institutions such as the sure that control measures and investments are made on asound basis with respect to global air pollution. There is also a need to mobilise new generations of scientists, scientists that are willing to cross boundaries andfocus on thematic problems and to build legitimacy among policymakers (e.g. Bouma 2016 ). Today we have more ence. It is also important to mobilise new generations ofdedicated policymakers. Unfortunately, we also see that politicians often are questioning science and seeing science which hopefully will not occur in the future. Instead wehope that it was an eye-opener and that industry instead can cleaner atmosphere. FINAL REMARKS industry, and the public worked together, the basis wasformed for the successful control of, what was considered, of the last century. We learnt from experience that science-based policy advice worked well when the best available knowledge was provided, and used to understand the speciﬁc problems, generate, and evaluate the policy optionsand monitor the outcomes of policy implementation.However, the world does not look the same today, and there are lessons to be learnt. Most important is thebuilding of mutual trust between science advisers and policymakers, and that both communities are honest about advice works best when it is guided by the ideal of co - tists and policymakers (SAPEA 2019 ).

While this paper is not an exhaustive review of all research areas in the ﬁeld of air quality, we have selected key topics that we feel are important from air quality research and policy health assessment, and air quality management and policy. In conducting the review, speciﬁc objectives were portance for air quality policy. The original concept of this review was borne at the International Conference outdoor sources. There is a growing need to have integrated air pollution and related observations from both ground-based and remote sensing instruments, including in particular those on satellites. The research should also capitalize on the growing area of low-cost sensors, while ensuring a quality of the measurements which are are signiﬁcant feedbacks, such as those related to aerosols, chemistry, and meteorology.

The difference between PM 10and UFP contribu-tions from road transport is a direct outcome of the small (V ouitsis et al., 2017). signiﬁcantly increases exposure to trafﬁc-induced pollution have been extensively studied, and comprehensive sets of emission factors have been available for a long time. The two most widespread methods to estimate emissions in Europe include COPERT (https://www.emisia.com/utilities/copert/, – the so-called ERMES database (https://www.ermes-group. factors in different modelling terms. COPERT is also a part of the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook (EMEP/EEA, 2019). tions. Emission factors are regularly being updated in an ef- sion levels.

Technological improvement in decreasing emissions from electric vehicles is non-exhaust PM coming from tyre, brake, 2021). New techniques are also being developed with the capacity such on-board monitoring systems is the on-board fuel con- sumption measurement (OBFCM) device which is already mandatory for new light-duty vehicles and is being extended emissions inventories. 3.2.4 Shipping emissions the 0.5 % sulfur cap in 2020, and typically are not equipped routes are frequently located in the vicinity of the coast, The environmental regulation concerning the sulfur emis- sions from ships has been in place in the Baltic Sea since North America and some Chinese coastal areas have strin- high-sulfur fuel in ships was allowed until the start of 2020, when sulfur reductions of a maximum of 0.5 % S were ex- tended to all ships (IMO, 2019). This has been estimated to al., 2018). Nitrogen oxide emissions from ships are regulated NOxreduction. The introduction of the automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS), long-range identiﬁcation and tracking (LRIT), and vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) have enabled tracking of individual ships in unprecedented detail. These navigational local and global scales. Currently, ship emission models using AIS data as an ac- tivity source are most popular. They can have accurate infor- models. Ship emission data are available on a global grid new routes in the Arctic. and departure following the same AIS-based approach as for at berth are estimated based on ship type and size, but with to comply with at least three options. The ﬁrst of these is fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment systems, which are commonly used (estuaries, ports) or water exchange is slow (e.g. the Baltic Sea) (Teuchies et al., 2020). The use of low-sulfur or LNG fuels is a fossil-based solu- tion, unless the fuel was made using renewable or fully syn- much on the engine type selected. Methane, methanol, and ammonia are three fuels which three fuels are also suitable for use in internal combustion engines as well as fuel cells. All three are hydrogen carri- els and have hydrogen production as an intermediary step. This could offer a viable pathway towards hydrogen-based existing fuel infrastructure (DNV-GL, 2019). 3.2.5 Emissions of indoor sources dividual exposure to pollutants, which is described later in is needed.

Different methods are used for source ap- portionment of ambient concentrations, each including cer- cases these methods are complementary to each other, and creases the uncertainties (Thunis et al., 2019). There are two principally different source apportionment models: the re- the source-oriented models based on sensitivity analyses per- tion is inverse modelling used for improvement of emission al., 2018). The main receptor models are the incremental (Lenschow) The Lenschow method is based on the assumption that source fected by the emission sources. This approach is based on the assumptions that the regional contribution is constant at regional background. The CMB is based on known source composition proﬁles and measured receptor species concen- source proﬁles, which ideally are from the region where the receptor is located and that should be contemporary with the underpinning ambient air measurements.

(iii) Research recommendations for deciphering the impacts of various particulate matter properties which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. et al. (2018) reported that there is a severe lack of epidemi- ological studies investigating the health impacts originating they pointed out that there is no clear distinction between PM thus, there is a limited number of studies assessing the re- spective health impacts. portance of the more advanced measures (in addition to PMmass fractions) are to some extent inconclusive. One reason for this uncertainty is that there are so many associations of pact of PM is the associated oxidative stress when the parti- cles are inhaled (e.g. see Gao et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). A possible explanation for the health effects from PM is based (Gao et al., 2020). One prominent emerging area is the evaluation of long- term, multi-decadal concentrations and meteorology on a sufﬁcient spatial resolution. Long-term and lifetime expo- sures are known to be more important in terms of human health, compared with short-term exposures. Comprehensive data sets are therefore needed, which will include multi- sets have already been reported (Kukkonen et al., 2018; Sid- et al., 2020; Siddika et al., 2020).

Sim- strategies, the changes are not assessed or monetized.

A possibility is to use the same ap- proach as with air pollution; i.e. estimate the marginal dam- does not lead to useful results. Uncertainties are too high and timation of impacts. An alternative approach to estimating marginal damage costs is to use marginal abatement costs. A basic law of envi- ronmental economics is that for pollution control a pareto- age costs (MDCs) are equal to marginal abatement costs (MACs). Thus, if MAC at the pareto-optimal state are known, they could be used instead of the MDCs. However, the pareto-optimal state is not known if MDCs are not known. But one could use an environmental aim that is universally optimal solution in the view of society and then estimate the MACs to reach this aim, which is then used for the assess- ment. This approach was ﬁrst proposed by Baumol and Oates (1971). so-called Paris Agreement, which was agreed on at the 2015 by a large number of countries, the most important aim was could be used as the basis for generating MACs. Bachmann (2020) has carried out a literature research of MDCs and MACs for GHG emissions.

The reason is later more expensive measures like producing and using fu- els that are produced from renewable electricity (power to X) will have a lower effect on air pollution reduction. In the following an example is shown where an efﬁcient cli-mate protection measure gets inefﬁcient if air pollution is in- cluded in the assessment. This example is the use of small wood ﬁrings in cities. Wood ﬁrings are climate friendly but that for wood ﬁrings that are operated in cities, the damage of gas emissions.

There are of course cross-cutting needs that are a prerequisite to further air quality research and de- dations for further research. There is a progressively important need to move from static annual inventories to those that are dynamic in terms of activ- ity patterns and of higher temporal resolution. This is driven and because there is an increasing availability of online ob- munity efforts are necessary for identifying and reducing un- certainties in emissions that have a large impact on the result- from source apportionment methods. One gap is the evaluation of agricultural emissions, which are still poorly understood, and improvements will support co-beneﬁts. While considerable effort has been devoted to es- timating NO xemissions, there are still uncertainties in the es- timation of VOC emissions. These uncertainties have direct contributions from secondary organic aerosols to regional ties is the estimation of VOC proﬁles in terms of the chemi- a shift has occurred to both low-sulfur and carbon-neutral or non-carbon fuels. airborne non-exhaust emissions is becoming more and more cles.

The motivation is growing for an inter-disciplinary approach to assess exposure and the mote sensing measurements, including satellite data, with atmospheric chemical transport and urban-scale dispersion modelling. timescales. PM, which is one of the most health-relevant air pollutants, is associated with many health effects, such as all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and Stafoggia et al., 2013; Weinmayr et al., 2010).

This has been Some recent studies (e.g. Schmid et al., 2019) have provided evidence on the advantages of using costs and beneﬁts for grated assessments. fuel for ships has been reduced to 0.5 % worldwide (IMO, 2019).

Gorham’s researches,like those of Smith a century before, were met by what at large. It was not until 1967 and 1968 when Svante Oden Committee Report (Ode ´n1968 ) that the acid rain problem was brought to both public and scientiﬁc considerations.The report included a huge body of scientiﬁc and policy- relevant evidence that long-distance transport and deposi- tion of acidifying pollutants were causing signiﬁcant environmental and ecological impacts, even in countries authors. The report included a broad environmentalassessment of the sulphur emission problem including sources, atmospheric and surface water chemistry, and included scenarios and estimated costs for environmental damage and control; in fact it was probably the ﬁrst full systems analysis of an environmental problem. In the report, a ﬁrst estimate was made of the relative were also made of the effects of sulphur emissions on 14r1.pdf ) regional air pollution was explicitly mentioned research, Nordforsk, was asked to plan and developmethodologies for the investigation.

In fact, substantial of the acid rain problem is the concept of Critical Loads control of sulphur and nitrogen emissions should be based Fig.4). (The critical loads concept is further discussed later in the paper) ferent approaches were developed, but the model at theInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis Sulphur Protocol signed in 1994 was agreed (Hordijk1995 ). gen oxides the concept could, however, not be used in thesame way as for sulphur and acid deposition, since the NO x emissions contributed to several effects and, in addition, astrategy would need to take additional compounds intoaccount. Instead, a more advanced approach was suggested were asked to develop an integrated assessment model that ﬁtted into a broader approach and a more comprehensivemodel was developed, which made it possible to simulta- basis for the Gothenburg Protocol (GP) that was signed in National Emissions Ceilings (NEC) Directive from 2001 outlined control measures for 2010 and beyond. /C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en 123Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 853 After 2000—Health effects and integration with other policies became main drivers The basis for the GP was almost entirely ecosystem effects. logical studies indicated that air pollution was a signiﬁcantsource of premature deaths and that particles were a main vention followed. Further studies have supported the role and for the ﬁrst time particulate matter was included in aninternational protocol (Reis et al. 2012 ). 1999, it was realised that for some pollutants under the AirConvention, emission control needed to be considered over alone. Ozone was of particular importance, since long-termobjectives in the form of critical levels and public health Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) was set upunder the Convention in 2004, with a primary objective to quantify the intercontinental transport of pollutants. The Climate change has for more than a decade become an acidity. Such maps have played an important role for illustrating outcomes of future policies as well as of actions taken (from Maas and Grennfelt 2016 ) Fig. 5 Links between sources and effects used as an illustration in the 123/C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en854 Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 policy.

SLCPs thus also includecompounds that are cooling the atmosphere, i.e. small secondary aerosols, e.g. sulphate particles. Recent research has focused on a better understanding of these compounds’contribution to both air pollution and climate as well as on Sand et al. 2016 ). Reactive nitrogen species are another group of com- of the century. Around 2006 several initiatives were takenin Europe, including a special task force on Reactive was considered both as a traditional atmospheric pollutant molecular nitrogen again, was introduced (Galloway et al.2003 ). The studies have pointed to the importance of the driver, and monitoring programmes were set up both in the National Atmospheric Deposition programme (NADP) started in 1976 and is still running. Both countries have taken part in the Air Convention activities and have signedmost of the protocols and achieved decreases in SO 2 emissions of the order of 80% between 1980 and 2015. TheUS has however taken a different approach with respect topolicy in comparison to Europe. Instead of developing a strategy based on integrated assessment modelling, it was INTERACTIONS rain and transboundary air pollution that have become effects to ecosystems), development of bridging concepts that have served the implementation of strategies, andﬁnally the dynamics in the science–policy interactions. ecosystem effects has been a key for understanding thecauses, impact, and trends in acid rain, both in Europe and (Table 2). The original EMEP network has since the start system. The originally established simple monitoring sta- tions have over time been complemented with moreadvanced monitoring, and some stations are today advanced atmospheric chemistry platforms with continuous collection of a multitude of atmospheric parameters (Fig. 6). The EMEP database is nowadays widely used for modelling. EMEP has also become a model for monitoring networks related to other geographical regions, conven-tions, and purposes. One example is the acid deposition monitoring network in East Asia (EANET). It is obvious that having a qualiﬁed centre for data collection and stor-age, standardisation, and intercalibration of methods has open nature is part of the success. The ﬁnancial support toEMEP, regulated through a separate protocol, has been monitoring activities. EMEP and was organised through so-called InternationalCooperative Programmes (ICPs). Separate programmes were set up for forests, waters, vegetation (primarily ozone), materials, and integrated monitoring.

The concept, ﬁrst discussed in 1982, was taken from the original idea to application quite quickly duringthe 1980s. The Swedish expert Jan Nilsson was a key makers, the concept gained the legitimacy on which poli-cies were developed. According to Jan Nilsson, it all have a sounder base for emission control, something thatcould express the long-term objectives for emission control policies. The concept was ﬁrst met by scepticism, not least loads were included in the plans for the next rounds of thesulphur and nitrogen protocols in 1988, it changed the way the Air Convention operated.

From the strategies strictly directed at ecosystem effects, the approach is now All the bridging concepts are to varying degrees it is important to keep transparency and conﬁdence in the underlying data and to scientiﬁcally evaluate and scrutinisethem. This is particularly important for the IAMs, which are the ﬁnal step in a chain of inputs (Fig. 8). The models have often been criticised, not least from industry and otherstakeholders that are questioning the priorities that result model calculations, has, however, been transparent, andcountries and stakeholders have always had the option to their own negotiation positions. Forming science–policy credibility crucially important to maintain scientiﬁc credibility. The close involvement of scientists has been a signature of the Air Convention. Scientists have always had a role at thepolicy meetings, communicating results from basic scien- a way that has been understandable and useful for thepolicy work. The role of the scientists has been as honest and observations of new problems have also been impor- tant, and have resulted in repeated changes in the framingsof the Air Convention to adapt to new situations: going interplay between the two communities has in this waybeen developed and maintained over time. Another factor is the building of networks. The strong during these four decades of the Convention is built on emissions in a cost-effective way. FUTURE CHALLENGES New approaches necessary International air pollution control is by many considered as a success story. However, the success is in many ways and development /C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en 123Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 859 industrialised countries (including Japan and Australia), where emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, VOCs, and some other compounds have been decreasedsigniﬁcantly (Maas and Grennfelt 2016 ). But even in the areas, where air pollution has been a top priority for several decades, air pollution remains a problem. Ecosystemeffects, which were the main reason for the establishment of the Convention, are to some extent reduced, but the emissions of ammonia have so far only been reduced by20–30% in Europe and even less in North America. Looking at health effects, it is difﬁcult to talk about suc- cess, when hundreds of thousands of inhabitants on bothcontinents are predicted to meet an earlier death due to air pollution. But the problem is even larger and more urgent when looking outside the traditional industrialised world. The focus is today on the large urban regions in the countries that are facing rapid population growth and industrialisation.Although large efforts now are being made to decrease sul- phur emissions in China—the world’s leading sulphur emitter—major challenges remain. In India and several othercountries, sulphur emissions are still increasing. Estimates airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/ ). It is assumed that ﬁne particles (PM2.5) are a main cause for the health effects. The new and great challenge is therefore to control air pol-lution in relation to health risks, in particular by decreasing exposure to the small particles. There is, however, a risk that control measures will only concentrations of particles have occurred during recentyears. At ﬁrst, these episodes were considered to be caused essentially by local emissions. More thorough analysis has, however, shown that they were to a large extent caused byregional emissions and buildup of high concentrations over Similar situations are also often encountered in urban are, as previously mentioned, also linked to interconti- nental and hemispheric scales. It is also obvious that the research communities within together. Health aspects are of importance both from airpollution and climate change perspectives, and heat wavescarry poor air quality as winds are often very low and the atmospheric boundary layer stagnant. During heat waves, and impacts on radiation balances. Modelling is a scientiﬁcarea where much progress has been made and where has allowed integration of atmospheric chemistry into theclimate models formulated as Earth system models, cou- simultaneously. The modelling approach can be further developed when observations are designed to map Earthsystem component boundaries to understand and quantify the ﬂows and interactions between different compartments, global-scale concepts such as ‘‘planetary boundaries’’ and ‘‘trajectories of the Earth system vs. planetary thresholds’’have been developed (Rockstro ¨m et al. 2009 ; Steffen et al. 2018 ). Solutions are available; driving forces and investments are lacking In 2016, the Air Convention launched a scientiﬁc report situation within the UNECE region was updated (Maas andGrennfelt 2016 ). The report also presented future chal- lems. It also showed that solutions are available for most ofthe identiﬁed problems at affordable costs below the health and ecosystem beneﬁts of the control actions. Even if solutions are available, many parts of the world are facing large problems in implementing them. There are several reasons, but often there is a lack of knowledge and resources. This is particularly true in many developingcountries. Another reason is the lack of political interest. Air pollution is still not of top priority among politicians, even if there is overwhelming evidence that air pollution isone of the most common causes of shortened life (e.g., industry and agriculture) are forming strong lobbyingforces delaying actions. 123/C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en860 Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 Air pollution is a problem that cannot be seen in isola- will be a win–win solution.

It is tional Law Commission, under which a proposal for a Lawfor the Protection of the Atmosphere has been prepared (http://legal.un.org/ilc/summaries/8_8.shtml ) but in the current international atmosphere there is a lack of politicalsupport to implement it. Our hope is that the situation will change soon—the initiative is too important to fail. The UN has put forward a very strong agenda in order to pollution is an integral part of several of the SGDs, like water. Climate change is a very signiﬁcant common and cross-cutting factor. The Air Convention has taken some steps in promoting well-developed structure, it has taken a role of making surethat international organisations having air pollution on its agenda are aware of each other and to invite to further collaboration and development. Initiatives are taken bothwithin the formal Convention structure and through dedi- which has proven successful in linking scientiﬁc evidence, monitoring, and integrated assessment modelling directed These new international initiatives have a strong emphasis on policy development. The experience from the50 years of international air pollution development is the value of well-deﬁned scientiﬁc objectives and activities supporting policy. The increased interest from WHO andUN Environment is welcome and there are expectations of situation in many parts of the world. However, for theseorganisations, air pollution is just one of several priority organisations are likely able to set up advanced infras-tructures with respect to emission inventories, monitoring, and its components, air pollution being an important part.This is in line with the WMO strategic plan and with fast tres like The European Centre for Medium Range WeatherForecast (ECMWF).

Today we have more ence. It is also important to mobilise new generations ofdedicated policymakers. Unfortunately, we also see that politicians often are questioning science and seeing science which hopefully will not occur in the future. Instead wehope that it was an eye-opener and that industry instead can cleaner atmosphere. FINAL REMARKS industry, and the public worked together, the basis wasformed for the successful control of, what was considered, of the last century. We learnt from experience that science-based policy advice worked well when the best available knowledge was provided, and used to understand the speciﬁc problems, generate, and evaluate the policy optionsand monitor the outcomes of policy implementation.However, the world does not look the same today, and there are lessons to be learnt. Most important is thebuilding of mutual trust between science advisers and policymakers, and that both communities are honest about advice works best when it is guided by the ideal of co - tists and policymakers (SAPEA 2019 ).

Data strongly suggest that effects have no threshold within the studied range of ambient background concentrations and that they follow a mostly linear concentration–response function. Hav- ing ﬁrmly established this signiﬁcant public health problem, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is in ambient PM that affects health and to understand the underlying biological basis of toxicity by identifying mechanistic pathways—information toring, forecasting and reporting that exploits increas- ingly sophisticated information systems.

The cause of deaths was broken down as follows: ischaemic heart disease (40 %), stroke are based not only on a greater understanding of thediseases caused by poor air quality, but also more accurate exposure assessment that utilises sophisti- cated measurement and modelling technology.

However, theproblem is very much a global one. Focusing on Europe, air pollution is again the biggest environment countries were estimated at 203,000 and 280,000,respectively (WHO 2014 ).

Current (2008)data estimate that if the effect of PM 2.5air pollution is considered by itself, it is responsible for at least UK, with mortality rate estimates from long-term PM London boroughs (PHE 2014 ).

Improved air quality and improved health We now also have consistent evidence that a reduction sustained intervention (mainly regulatory actions) is associated with improvements in public health. In theUSA, Pope et al. ( 2009 ) used data from the 51 cities long-term PM 2.5data are available. It was reported that reduction in PM 2.5concentration between 1980 and 2000 was strongly associated with 2.7 year overallincreases in life expectancy that occurred during that period (Fig. 3). Evidence has also been demonstrated 2002—a period when the annual average PM 10 concentration decreased by 5–6 lg/m3. This reduction in particle levels was associated with attenuation in theannual rate of decline of lung function (Downs et al. 2007 ). Using the same cohort, Schindler et al.

Evidence is also conclusive that long- term (annual) BC exposure is associated with all-causeand cardiopulmonary mortality. Although distinct mechanistic effects have not been identiﬁed from toxicological studies, suggesting that BC may not be adirect toxic component of ﬁne PM, it is hypothesised beyond. Furthermore, in that short-term studies showthat health effect associations with BC were more robust than those with PM 2.5or PM 10, although BC particles may not constitute a causal agent, it is theopinion that they may well serve as a better indicator of harmful particulate substances (e.g. organics) from Organic carbonOC is a very complex and heterogenous mixture of As a consequence, it is a huge challenge to identify thepotential toxicity of speciﬁc OC constituents and in fact evidence is currently insufﬁcient to distinguish between the toxicity of primary and secondary organicaerosols.

Mechanisms of PM toxicity The well-established evidence that PM pollution contributes to an array of health outcomes has resulted mechanistic pathways.

Factors determining awareness Other than the availability of sufﬁcient information governing how aware individuals are about the quality Fig. 4 Biological pathways linking PM exposure withoxidative and inﬂammatory pathways in the lung and cardiovasculature640 Environ Geochem Health (2015) 37:631–649 123 are likely to include understanding, perception and a standing of what is undoubtedly a complex science. Unlike other environmental risks that are routinelycommunicated such as UV and heat, overall air quality encompasses several primary pollutants as well as secondary products owing to atmospheric transforma-tion. Rural areas for example are very often considered times, O concentrations of nitrogen oxides to sequester rural O3. A lack of vested interest in the topic is also possible amongst ‘healthy’ people, less likely to have pollution and/or increasing medication may bring.Indeed, where research has indicated that individuals are aware of air quality warnings and take responsive actions, larger responses were observed for moresusceptible groups or carers thereof (McDermott et al. is another factor inﬂuencing the public understanding data generated by monitoring sites and communicated via an advisory service (Shooter and Brimblecombe2009 ). Several studies have investigated the relation- ship between perceived and measured outdoor air (Atari et al. 2009 ), others have found little or no rather than the advisory service, drove the response.Some epidemiological researchers have also indicated that self-reported health status is associated with et al. 2008 ).Information services Public awareness is fundamentally dependent upon optimal air pollution monitoring, forecasting and reporting. Many countries have air quality monitoringnetworks that are structured around a particular country’s regulatory obligation to report monitored lutants, air quality modelling systems and meteoro- logical data are also processed to create a national airquality index (AQI). Again in line with national legislation, an AQI communicates pollution levels and short term; Table 1). These data are used by the public Another information tool is provided by accessible air tion events via a computer/tablet (websites, email, social media) or phone (texts, apps) (London AirQuality Network; City of London). These are becom- ing increasingly informative and engaging, allowing example, providing low pollution journey planners to reduce exposure (Fig. 5). New developments Whilst monitoring, forecasting and reporting of air quality have become increasingly sophisticated and 123 systems sourced by ﬁxed site monitoring stations are monitors was primarily limited to industries associ- children (Spira-Cohen et al. 2011 ). Now we are witnessing an emerging role for inexpensive, portable, easy-to-use personal monitoring devices (Austen by such sensors is not currently robust enough to compliment data for ofﬁcial monitoring networks, there is undoubtedly a need for more dynamicmeasures of time-activity patterns in relation to low-cost air quality sensors, also has the potential to Added to their ubiquitous technology, the penetrationof these phones is unrivalled in demographics, possibilities in the communication of individual research setting, novel smartphone-based software that records people’s movements and physical activitylevels in the urban environment and is integrated with spatial–temporal maps of air pollution is already being Discussion fore that health effects of PM—one of the pollutantsdeemed most dangerous to health—are well docu- mented.

DEPs are nowclassiﬁed as carcinogenic, and an increasing number of studies are investigating the potential for particulate We now also appreciate that there is no evidence of a studies are showing associations between PM and 2.5. Correspondingly, reductions in population exposure to air pollution appreciable beneﬁts in terms of increased life expectancy and improvements to respiratory health. Having ﬁrmly established associations between ambient PM and adverse health effects, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is inambient PM that affects health—information that in characteristics or sources to be deﬁnitely identiﬁed comparing and synthesising data from existing studies is therefore needed before concluding thatadditional indicators (be they BC or UFPs) have a toxicity by identifying pathways that ultimately link obstructive pulmonary diseases. 123 Evidence has emerged that (a) the burden of ambient PM pollution on health is signiﬁcant at relatively low concentrations, (b) there is no safelower limit and (c) effects follow a mostly linear concentration–response function, suggesting that pub- lic health beneﬁts will result from any reduction inconcentrations.

Fussell let alone the health-based World Health Organisation has been a substantial increase in ﬁndings that particulate matter (PM) air pollution is not only points, but is also associated with a broader number of disease outcomes. Data strongly suggest that effects have no threshold within the studied range of ambient background concentrations and that they follow a mostly linear concentration–response function. Hav- ing ﬁrmly established this signiﬁcant public health problem, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is in ambient PM that affects health and to understand the underlying biological basis of toxicity by identifying mechanistic pathways—information toring, forecasting and reporting that exploits increas- ingly sophisticated information systems. Improving air quality is a considerable but not an intractable challenge. Translating the correct scientiﬁc evidence into bold, realistic and effective policies undisputedly has the potential to reduce air pollution so that it no health. awareness /C1Air quality communication Introduction Historical perspective Air pollution is now fully acknowledged to be a signiﬁcant public health problem, responsible for a growing range of health effects that are well docu- conducted in many regions of the world.

This in turn has led to a speculative link to the daily inhalation of smoke inconﬁned spaces from fuels used for warmth, cooking and lighting.

The cause of deaths was broken down as follows: ischaemic heart disease (40 %), stroke are based not only on a greater understanding of thediseases caused by poor air quality, but also more accurate exposure assessment that utilises sophisti- cated measurement and modelling technology.

However, theproblem is very much a global one. Focusing on Europe, air pollution is again the biggest environment countries were estimated at 203,000 and 280,000,respectively (WHO 2014 ).

Current (2008)data estimate that if the effect of PM 2.5air pollution is considered by itself, it is responsible for at least UK, with mortality rate estimates from long-term PM London boroughs (PHE 2014 ). Upon comparing commonly acknowledged mortality risks, it has been estimated that a 10 lg/m3reduction in ambient PM 2.5pollution (roughly equivalent to eradicating all anthropogenic particles) would have a larger endpoints has been subject to intense study, resulting 2.5and PM 10, with nega- tive impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health following both short-term and chronic exposures.Furthermore, data strongly suggest that effects have no 2.5background concentration–response function (WHO 2013a ).

Improved air quality and improved health We now also have consistent evidence that a reduction sustained intervention (mainly regulatory actions) is associated with improvements in public health. In theUSA, Pope et al. ( 2009 ) used data from the 51 cities long-term PM 2.5data are available. It was reported that reduction in PM 2.5concentration between 1980 and 2000 was strongly associated with 2.7 year overallincreases in life expectancy that occurred during that period (Fig. 3). Evidence has also been demonstrated 2002—a period when the annual average PM 10 concentration decreased by 5–6 lg/m3. This reduction in particle levels was associated with attenuation in theannual rate of decline of lung function (Downs et al. 2007 ). Using the same cohort, Schindler et al. ( 2009 ) 123 10 was associated with improved respiratory health(reduced incidence of chronic cough, bronchitis,common cold, nocturnal dry cough and conjunctivitis health of the Swiss children occurred following optimal air quality management.

Black carbon 2013a ), the health effects of BC particles have also initiatives have conﬁrmed that sufﬁcient epidemio- logical evidence exists to link short-term (daily) admissions. Evidence is also conclusive that long- term (annual) BC exposure is associated with all-causeand cardiopulmonary mortality. Although distinct mechanistic effects have not been identiﬁed from toxicological studies, suggesting that BC may not be adirect toxic component of ﬁne PM, it is hypothesised beyond. Furthermore, in that short-term studies showthat health effect associations with BC were more robust than those with PM 2.5or PM 10, although BC particles may not constitute a causal agent, it is theopinion that they may well serve as a better indicator of harmful particulate substances (e.g. organics) from Organic carbonOC is a very complex and heterogenous mixture of As a consequence, it is a huge challenge to identify thepotential toxicity of speciﬁc OC constituents and in fact evidence is currently insufﬁcient to distinguish between the toxicity of primary and secondary organicaerosols. Studies are, however, generating increasing endpoints. Ostro et al. ( 2010 ) has also observed associations between long-term exposure to organic monary mortality.

Mechanisms of PM toxicity The well-established evidence that PM pollution contributes to an array of health outcomes has resulted mechanistic pathways. Although there remains much short- and long-term PM 2.5exposure with mortality and morbidity has evolved rapidly and continues to doso.

( 2004 ) have also hypothesised induced mortality observed across US communities.Other research has concluded that both awareness of understanding of air quality information are lackingamongst the public (Bickerstaff and Walker 2001 ; European Commission (EC) conducted a ﬂash Euro-barometer to gain a greater insight into the views of the disorders, cardiovascular diseases and asthma/allergy were 87, 92 and 87 % respectively. Factors determining awareness Other than the availability of sufﬁcient information governing how aware individuals are about the quality Fig. 4 Biological pathways linking PM exposure withoxidative and inﬂammatory pathways in the lung and cardiovasculature640 Environ Geochem Health (2015) 37:631–649 123 are likely to include understanding, perception and a standing of what is undoubtedly a complex science. Unlike other environmental risks that are routinelycommunicated such as UV and heat, overall air quality encompasses several primary pollutants as well as secondary products owing to atmospheric transforma-tion. Rural areas for example are very often considered times, O concentrations of nitrogen oxides to sequester rural O3. A lack of vested interest in the topic is also possible amongst ‘healthy’ people, less likely to have pollution and/or increasing medication may bring.Indeed, where research has indicated that individuals are aware of air quality warnings and take responsive actions, larger responses were observed for moresusceptible groups or carers thereof (McDermott et al. is another factor inﬂuencing the public understanding data generated by monitoring sites and communicated via an advisory service (Shooter and Brimblecombe2009 ). Several studies have investigated the relation- ship between perceived and measured outdoor air (Atari et al. 2009 ), others have found little or no rather than the advisory service, drove the response.Some epidemiological researchers have also indicated that self-reported health status is associated with et al. 2008 ).Information services Public awareness is fundamentally dependent upon optimal air pollution monitoring, forecasting and reporting. Many countries have air quality monitoringnetworks that are structured around a particular country’s regulatory obligation to report monitored lutants, air quality modelling systems and meteoro- logical data are also processed to create a national airquality index (AQI). Again in line with national legislation, an AQI communicates pollution levels and short term; Table 1). These data are used by the public Another information tool is provided by accessible air tion events via a computer/tablet (websites, email, social media) or phone (texts, apps) (London AirQuality Network; City of London). These are becom- ing increasingly informative and engaging, allowing example, providing low pollution journey planners to reduce exposure (Fig. 5). New developments Whilst monitoring, forecasting and reporting of air quality have become increasingly sophisticated and 123 systems sourced by ﬁxed site monitoring stations are monitors was primarily limited to industries associ- children (Spira-Cohen et al. 2011 ). Now we are witnessing an emerging role for inexpensive, portable, easy-to-use personal monitoring devices (Austen by such sensors is not currently robust enough to compliment data for ofﬁcial monitoring networks, there is undoubtedly a need for more dynamicmeasures of time-activity patterns in relation to low-cost air quality sensors, also has the potential to Added to their ubiquitous technology, the penetrationof these phones is unrivalled in demographics, possibilities in the communication of individual research setting, novel smartphone-based software that records people’s movements and physical activitylevels in the urban environment and is integrated with spatial–temporal maps of air pollution is already being Discussion fore that health effects of PM—one of the pollutantsdeemed most dangerous to health—are well docu- mented.

DEPs are nowclassiﬁed as carcinogenic, and an increasing number of studies are investigating the potential for particulate We now also appreciate that there is no evidence of a studies are showing associations between PM and 2.5. Correspondingly, reductions in population exposure to air pollution appreciable beneﬁts in terms of increased life expectancy and improvements to respiratory health. Having ﬁrmly established associations between ambient PM and adverse health effects, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is inambient PM that affects health—information that in characteristics or sources to be deﬁnitely identiﬁed comparing and synthesising data from existing studies is therefore needed before concluding thatadditional indicators (be they BC or UFPs) have a toxicity by identifying pathways that ultimately link obstructive pulmonary diseases. 123 Evidence has emerged that (a) the burden of ambient PM pollution on health is signiﬁcant at relatively low concentrations, (b) there is no safelower limit and (c) effects follow a mostly linear concentration–response function, suggesting that pub- lic health beneﬁts will result from any reduction inconcentrations.

While this paper is not an exhaustive review of all research areas in the ﬁeld of air quality, we have selected key topics that we feel are important from air quality research and policy health assessment, and air quality management and policy. In conducting the review, speciﬁc objectives were portance for air quality policy. The original concept of this review was borne at the International Conference outdoor sources. There is a growing need to have integrated air pollution and related observations from both ground-based and remote sensing instruments, including in particular those on satellites. The research should also capitalize on the growing area of low-cost sensors, while ensuring a quality of the measurements which are are signiﬁcant feedbacks, such as those related to aerosols, chemistry, and meteorology.

The introduction of the automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS), long-range identiﬁcation and tracking (LRIT), and vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) have enabled tracking of individual ships in unprecedented detail. These navigational local and global scales. Currently, ship emission models using AIS data as an ac- tivity source are most popular. They can have accurate infor- models. Ship emission data are available on a global grid new routes in the Arctic. and departure following the same AIS-based approach as for at berth are estimated based on ship type and size, but with to comply with at least three options. The ﬁrst of these is fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment systems, which are commonly used (estuaries, ports) or water exchange is slow (e.g. the Baltic Sea) (Teuchies et al., 2020). The use of low-sulfur or LNG fuels is a fossil-based solu- tion, unless the fuel was made using renewable or fully syn- much on the engine type selected. Methane, methanol, and ammonia are three fuels which three fuels are also suitable for use in internal combustion engines as well as fuel cells. All three are hydrogen carri- els and have hydrogen production as an intermediary step.

The factors may also have either syner- impacts of various PM properties are also known to be phys- In summary, there are many associations of various PM of these inter-dependencies are known relatively better, either qualitatively or quantitatively, while there are also numerous associations, which are currently known poorly. (iii) Research recommendations for deciphering the impacts of various particulate matter properties which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. et al. (2018) reported that there is a severe lack of epidemi- ological studies investigating the health impacts originating they pointed out that there is no clear distinction between PM thus, there is a limited number of studies assessing the re- spective health impacts. portance of the more advanced measures (in addition to PMmass fractions) are to some extent inconclusive. One reason for this uncertainty is that there are so many associations of pact of PM is the associated oxidative stress when the parti- cles are inhaled (e.g. see Gao et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). A possible explanation for the health effects from PM is based (Gao et al., 2020). One prominent emerging area is the evaluation of long- term, multi-decadal concentrations and meteorology on a sufﬁcient spatial resolution. Long-term and lifetime expo- sures are known to be more important in terms of human health, compared with short-term exposures. Comprehensive data sets are therefore needed, which will include multi- sets have already been reported (Kukkonen et al., 2018; Sid- et al., 2020; Siddika et al., 2020).

A possibility is to use the same ap- proach as with air pollution; i.e. estimate the marginal dam- does not lead to useful results. Uncertainties are too high and timation of impacts. An alternative approach to estimating marginal damage costs is to use marginal abatement costs. A basic law of envi- ronmental economics is that for pollution control a pareto- age costs (MDCs) are equal to marginal abatement costs (MACs). Thus, if MAC at the pareto-optimal state are known, they could be used instead of the MDCs. However, the pareto-optimal state is not known if MDCs are not known. But one could use an environmental aim that is universally optimal solution in the view of society and then estimate the MACs to reach this aim, which is then used for the assess- ment. This approach was ﬁrst proposed by Baumol and Oates (1971). so-called Paris Agreement, which was agreed on at the 2015 by a large number of countries, the most important aim was could be used as the basis for generating MACs. Bachmann (2020) has carried out a literature research of MDCs and MACs for GHG emissions.

Secondly, the marginal avoidance costs per tonne of avoided carbon are re- duced, especially for the period 2020–2035. The reason is later more expensive measures like producing and using fu- els that are produced from renewable electricity (power to X) will have a lower effect on air pollution reduction. In the following an example is shown where an efﬁcient cli-mate protection measure gets inefﬁcient if air pollution is in- cluded in the assessment. This example is the use of small wood ﬁrings in cities. Wood ﬁrings are climate friendly but that for wood ﬁrings that are operated in cities, the damage of gas emissions.

There are of course cross-cutting needs that are a prerequisite to further air quality research and de- dations for further research. There is a progressively important need to move from static annual inventories to those that are dynamic in terms of activ- ity patterns and of higher temporal resolution. This is driven and because there is an increasing availability of online ob- munity efforts are necessary for identifying and reducing un- certainties in emissions that have a large impact on the result- from source apportionment methods. One gap is the evaluation of agricultural emissions, which are still poorly understood, and improvements will support co-beneﬁts. While considerable effort has been devoted to es- timating NO xemissions, there are still uncertainties in the es- timation of VOC emissions. These uncertainties have direct contributions from secondary organic aerosols to regional ties is the estimation of VOC proﬁles in terms of the chemi- a shift has occurred to both low-sulfur and carbon-neutral or non-carbon fuels. airborne non-exhaust emissions is becoming more and more cles. Emission factors for ultra-ﬁne particles are also uncer- tain; these are also spatially and temporally highly variable, al., 2016a). Exposure connects emissions to concentrations and their is determined by all sources of that air pollutant, both in- door and outdoor sources are important.

Advanced approaches are needed to deposition over vegetation surfaces to further assess the ef- fectiveness of nature-based solutions to improve air quality in cities. 10.5 Air quality exposure and health Air-quality-related observations to support air quality health impact studies are heterogeneous; for many developing re- gions, such as Africa, ground-based monitoring is sparse or non-existent (Rees at al., 2019). The motivation is growing for an inter-disciplinary approach to assess exposure and the mote sensing measurements, including satellite data, with atmospheric chemical transport and urban-scale dispersion modelling. timescales. PM, which is one of the most health-relevant air pollutants, is associated with many health effects, such as all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and Stafoggia et al., 2013; Weinmayr et al., 2010). There have concentrations (PNCs), secondary organic PM, primary PM, metals, and toxic or hazardous pollutants. ponents has also stimulated further debate on the optimal concentration–response functions and on the necessity of (about 374 000 premature deaths) were linked to exposure PM 2:5exposure may have been considerably underestimated. The worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has raised global interest anisms are not yet clear and require concerted effort (e.g. Pisoni and Van Dingenen, 2020). There is also evidence that is also becoming clearer, where dynamic diurnal activity pat- macher et al.

Correspondingly, integrated assessment activities for climate protection have started to include im- ergy and Industrial Strategy, have also recommended an inte- 2019).

This has an implication for epidemiologi- cal studies, which usually are based on correlation betweenmodelled or measured concentrations at outdoor locations Interdependence of air pollution and climatically active also shows that costs of meeting policy obligations for cli- eﬁts of reduced climate change are much smaller than the impacts caused by increased air pollution. This has been Some recent studies (e.g. Schmid et al., 2019) have provided evidence on the advantages of using costs and beneﬁts for grated assessments. fuel for ships has been reduced to 0.5 % worldwide (IMO, 2019). The EURO 6d norm has led to a signiﬁcant reduction Council has recently (in September 2020) agreed to reduce fossil fuels. However, there is one exception: small wood (e.g. Kukkonen et al., 2020b).

            "1. **Ground-based reference monitoring stations**: These provide high-precision, regulatory-grade measurements using standardized instruments (e.g., gravimetric samplers, beta attenuation monitors, or tapered element oscillating microbalances). They form the backbone of official air quality networks but are limited in spatial coverage due to cost and infrastructure requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Low-cost sensors (LCS)**: These offer higher spatial density and real-time data at reduced cost, enabling deployment in citizen science projects and dense urban networks. However, they require rigorous calibration, quality assurance protocols, and intercomparison with reference instruments to ensure data reliability.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Satellite remote sensing**: Provides broad spatial coverage and columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, which can be converted to surface PM₂.₅ estimates using retrieval algorithms. This technique is valuable for regional and global assessments but may lack fine temporal resolution and direct surface-level accuracy.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Mobile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms**: Enable dynamic, three-dimensional measurements to capture spatial gradients and vertical profiles of PM₂.₅, especially in complex environments like cities or near emission sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Integrated and multi-platform approaches**: Combining data from reference stations, LCS networks, satellite retrievals, and mobile measurements through data assimilation, geostatistical fusion, or machine learning techniques enhances spatial resolution and accuracy while addressing gaps in individual methods.\n",

These are typically operated by governmental agencies and form the backbone of compliance monitoring networks.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Low-cost sensors (LCS)** enable dense spatial coverage and high-resolution mapping of PM₂.₅ concentrations, particularly in urban areas. While they generally have higher uncertainties and require calibration, they are valuable for identifying pollution hotspots, supporting citizen science initiatives, and supplementing reference networks. Their data can be improved through correction algorithms and colocation with reference instruments.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Satellite-based remote sensing** offers broad spatial coverage and is effective for assessing regional and global PM₂.₅ patterns, including transboundary pollution transport. These measurements are particularly useful for evaluating chemical transport models and studying large-scale atmospheric processes.\n",

While this paper is not an exhaustive review of all research areas in the ﬁeld of air quality, we have selected key topics that we feel are important from air quality research and policy health assessment, and air quality management and policy. In conducting the review, speciﬁc objectives were portance for air quality policy. The original concept of this review was borne at the International Conference outdoor sources. There is a growing need to have integrated air pollution and related observations from both ground-based and remote sensing instruments, including in particular those on satellites. The research should also capitalize on the growing area of low-cost sensors, while ensuring a quality of the measurements which are are signiﬁcant feedbacks, such as those related to aerosols, chemistry, and meteorology.

This has been estimated to al., 2018). Nitrogen oxide emissions from ships are regulated NOxreduction. The introduction of the automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS), long-range identiﬁcation and tracking (LRIT), and vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) have enabled tracking of individual ships in unprecedented detail. These navigational local and global scales. Currently, ship emission models using AIS data as an ac- tivity source are most popular. They can have accurate infor- models. Ship emission data are available on a global grid new routes in the Arctic. and departure following the same AIS-based approach as for at berth are estimated based on ship type and size, but with to comply with at least three options. The ﬁrst of these is fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment systems, which are commonly used (estuaries, ports) or water exchange is slow (e.g. the Baltic Sea) (Teuchies et al., 2020). The use of low-sulfur or LNG fuels is a fossil-based solu- tion, unless the fuel was made using renewable or fully syn- much on the engine type selected. Methane, methanol, and ammonia are three fuels which three fuels are also suitable for use in internal combustion engines as well as fuel cells. All three are hydrogen carri- els and have hydrogen production as an intermediary step. This could offer a viable pathway towards hydrogen-based existing fuel infrastructure (DNV-GL, 2019). 3.2.5 Emissions of indoor sources dividual exposure to pollutants, which is described later in is needed.

Different methods are used for source ap- portionment of ambient concentrations, each including cer- cases these methods are complementary to each other, and creases the uncertainties (Thunis et al., 2019). There are two principally different source apportionment models: the re- the source-oriented models based on sensitivity analyses per- tion is inverse modelling used for improvement of emission al., 2018).

This approach is based on the assumptions that the regional contribution is constant at regional background.

(iii) Research recommendations for deciphering the impacts of various particulate matter properties which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. et al. (2018) reported that there is a severe lack of epidemi- ological studies investigating the health impacts originating they pointed out that there is no clear distinction between PM thus, there is a limited number of studies assessing the re- spective health impacts. portance of the more advanced measures (in addition to PMmass fractions) are to some extent inconclusive. One reason for this uncertainty is that there are so many associations of pact of PM is the associated oxidative stress when the parti- cles are inhaled (e.g. see Gao et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). A possible explanation for the health effects from PM is based (Gao et al., 2020). One prominent emerging area is the evaluation of long- term, multi-decadal concentrations and meteorology on a sufﬁcient spatial resolution. Long-term and lifetime expo- sures are known to be more important in terms of human health, compared with short-term exposures. Comprehensive data sets are therefore needed, which will include multi- sets have already been reported (Kukkonen et al., 2018; Sid- et al., 2020; Siddika et al., 2020).

Sim- strategies, the changes are not assessed or monetized.

A possibility is to use the same ap- proach as with air pollution; i.e. estimate the marginal dam- does not lead to useful results. Uncertainties are too high and timation of impacts. An alternative approach to estimating marginal damage costs is to use marginal abatement costs. A basic law of envi- ronmental economics is that for pollution control a pareto- age costs (MDCs) are equal to marginal abatement costs (MACs). Thus, if MAC at the pareto-optimal state are known, they could be used instead of the MDCs. However, the pareto-optimal state is not known if MDCs are not known. But one could use an environmental aim that is universally optimal solution in the view of society and then estimate the MACs to reach this aim, which is then used for the assess- ment. This approach was ﬁrst proposed by Baumol and Oates (1971). so-called Paris Agreement, which was agreed on at the 2015 by a large number of countries, the most important aim was could be used as the basis for generating MACs. Bachmann (2020) has carried out a literature research of MDCs and MACs for GHG emissions.

Secondly, the marginal avoidance costs per tonne of avoided carbon are re- duced, especially for the period 2020–2035. The reason is later more expensive measures like producing and using fu- els that are produced from renewable electricity (power to X) will have a lower effect on air pollution reduction. In the following an example is shown where an efﬁcient cli-mate protection measure gets inefﬁcient if air pollution is in- cluded in the assessment. This example is the use of small wood ﬁrings in cities. Wood ﬁrings are climate friendly but that for wood ﬁrings that are operated in cities, the damage of gas emissions.

There are of course cross-cutting needs that are a prerequisite to further air quality research and de- dations for further research. There is a progressively important need to move from static annual inventories to those that are dynamic in terms of activ- ity patterns and of higher temporal resolution. This is driven and because there is an increasing availability of online ob- munity efforts are necessary for identifying and reducing un- certainties in emissions that have a large impact on the result- from source apportionment methods. One gap is the evaluation of agricultural emissions, which are still poorly understood, and improvements will support co-beneﬁts. While considerable effort has been devoted to es- timating NO xemissions, there are still uncertainties in the es- timation of VOC emissions.

The importance of shipping emissions is growing, as there is a shift to carbon-neutral or zero-carbon fuels. Emission factors for VOC from shipping are generally less certain, and hence little is known about their contribution to particle and ozone formation. To estimate the total environmental impact of shipping, integrated approaches are needed that bring to- and (iii) climatic forcing. cleaning agents, are becoming more important, as are com- heating, and cooking, which are important sources of PM 2:5, models is expected to increase, as they have to include both 10.2 Observations to support air quality research Regarding observation of air quality, this review has focused remote sensing technics. Connecting observational data with air pollution exposure has also been discussed. Remote sensing measurements including satellite obser- vations have a signiﬁcant role in air quality management chine learning algorithms are increasingly being used with advances have highlighted the potential of statistical analy- quality at the city scale based on data generated by station- data fusion is allowing ﬁne spatial mapping by combining Schneider et al., 2017). Applications of LCS as well as networks based on such sensors have increased over the past decade (e.g. Thompson, et al., 2021). These applications have also highlighted the al., 2020). 10.3 Air quality modelling lution, has relied heavily on the continuing developments, ap- CFD and RANS models used for very high resolution disper- CTMs used for urban to regional scales.

Over the last decade new developments have focused on models and machine learning have shown a more detailed imissis et al., 2018). CTMs have also been developed to im- prove spatial resolution, for example, through downscaling al., 2017).

There are also continued improvements from higher-spatial-resolution modelling and interconnected multiscale processes, while maintaining realistic computa- tional times. Many advances have taken place in the de- velopment and use of coupled regional-scale meteorology– 2018a). These advances contribute to assess complex inter- actions between meteorology, emission, and chemistry, for CTM systems is still an evolving ﬁeld of research; it has ban observations (including meteorological, chemical, and hac, 2021).

Advanced approaches are needed to deposition over vegetation surfaces to further assess the ef- fectiveness of nature-based solutions to improve air quality in cities. 10.5 Air quality exposure and health Air-quality-related observations to support air quality health impact studies are heterogeneous; for many developing re- gions, such as Africa, ground-based monitoring is sparse or non-existent (Rees at al., 2019). The motivation is growing for an inter-disciplinary approach to assess exposure and the mote sensing measurements, including satellite data, with atmospheric chemical transport and urban-scale dispersion modelling. timescales. PM, which is one of the most health-relevant air pollutants, is associated with many health effects, such as all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and Stafoggia et al., 2013; Weinmayr et al., 2010). There have concentrations (PNCs), secondary organic PM, primary PM, metals, and toxic or hazardous pollutants. ponents has also stimulated further debate on the optimal concentration–response functions and on the necessity of (about 374 000 premature deaths) were linked to exposure PM 2:5exposure may have been considerably underestimated. The worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has raised global interest anisms are not yet clear and require concerted effort (e.g. Pisoni and Van Dingenen, 2020). There is also evidence that is also becoming clearer, where dynamic diurnal activity pat- macher et al. (2019), for example, has also demonstrated the importance of the movements of people to assess exposure. which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. 10.6 Air quality management and policy Integrated assessment of air pollution control policies has progressively developed over the last 2 decades and has been widely used as a tool for air quality management (e.g. EC, lution control in research projects has started to take account of climate change. Correspondingly, integrated assessment activities for climate protection have started to include im- ergy and Industrial Strategy, have also recommended an inte- 2019). Impact pathway approaches are also currently increas- Friedrich, 2019). This has an implication for epidemiologi- cal studies, which usually are based on correlation betweenmodelled or measured concentrations at outdoor locations Interdependence of air pollution and climatically active also shows that costs of meeting policy obligations for cli- eﬁts of reduced climate change are much smaller than the impacts caused by increased air pollution. This has been Some recent studies (e.g. Schmid et al., 2019) have provided evidence on the advantages of using costs and beneﬁts for grated assessments. fuel for ships has been reduced to 0.5 % worldwide (IMO, 2019). The EURO 6d norm has led to a signiﬁcant reduction Council has recently (in September 2020) agreed to reduce fossil fuels. However, there is one exception: small wood (e.g. Kukkonen et al., 2020b). While direct combustion emissions are expected to de- eas that pose challenges for air quality management are the (especially ammonium nitrates).

The studies have pointed to the importance of the driver, and monitoring programmes were set up both in the National Atmospheric Deposition programme (NADP) started in 1976 and is still running. Both countries have taken part in the Air Convention activities and have signedmost of the protocols and achieved decreases in SO 2 emissions of the order of 80% between 1980 and 2015. TheUS has however taken a different approach with respect topolicy in comparison to Europe. Instead of developing a strategy based on integrated assessment modelling, it was INTERACTIONS rain and transboundary air pollution that have become effects to ecosystems), development of bridging concepts that have served the implementation of strategies, andﬁnally the dynamics in the science–policy interactions. ecosystem effects has been a key for understanding thecauses, impact, and trends in acid rain, both in Europe and (Table 2). The original EMEP network has since the start system. The originally established simple monitoring sta- tions have over time been complemented with moreadvanced monitoring, and some stations are today advanced atmospheric chemistry platforms with continuous collection of a multitude of atmospheric parameters (Fig. 6). The EMEP database is nowadays widely used for modelling. EMEP has also become a model for monitoring networks related to other geographical regions, conven-tions, and purposes. One example is the acid deposition monitoring network in East Asia (EANET). It is obvious that having a qualiﬁed centre for data collection and stor-age, standardisation, and intercalibration of methods has open nature is part of the success. The ﬁnancial support toEMEP, regulated through a separate protocol, has been monitoring activities. EMEP and was organised through so-called InternationalCooperative Programmes (ICPs). Separate programmes were set up for forests, waters, vegetation (primarily ozone), materials, and integrated monitoring. A separateICP was set up for developing critical load methodologies and coordinating European-scale mapping activities (ICP Modelling and Mapping).

The concept, ﬁrst discussed in 1982, was taken from the original idea to application quite quickly duringthe 1980s. The Swedish expert Jan Nilsson was a key makers, the concept gained the legitimacy on which poli-cies were developed. According to Jan Nilsson, it all have a sounder base for emission control, something thatcould express the long-term objectives for emission control policies. The concept was ﬁrst met by scepticism, not least loads were included in the plans for the next rounds of thesulphur and nitrogen protocols in 1988, it changed the way the Air Convention operated. The application of the critical loads concept has encouraged intense research over several decades where the main objective has been to ﬁnd simple chemical effects of dissolved aluminium on ﬁsh often were chosen as the main biological effect, the acidity of the water, mostlyexpressed as acid neutralising capacity (ANC), is used (e.g. roots is considered as critical, the Al 3?to Ca2?ratio in soil water has become the main effect parameter (Sverdrup Integrated assessment modelling (IAM) also has been a goes back to the work at IIASA in the beginning of 1980s.A conceptual model was formulated by Joseph Alcamo, bringing together the scientiﬁc knowledge to a 123/C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en858 Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 framing environmental policies.

From the strategies strictly directed at ecosystem effects, the approach is now All the bridging concepts are to varying degrees it is important to keep transparency and conﬁdence in the underlying data and to scientiﬁcally evaluate and scrutinisethem. This is particularly important for the IAMs, which are the ﬁnal step in a chain of inputs (Fig. 8). The models have often been criticised, not least from industry and otherstakeholders that are questioning the priorities that result model calculations, has, however, been transparent, andcountries and stakeholders have always had the option to their own negotiation positions. Forming science–policy credibility crucially important to maintain scientiﬁc credibility. The close involvement of scientists has been a signature of the Air Convention. Scientists have always had a role at thepolicy meetings, communicating results from basic scien- a way that has been understandable and useful for thepolicy work. The role of the scientists has been as honest and observations of new problems have also been impor- tant, and have resulted in repeated changes in the framingsof the Air Convention to adapt to new situations: going interplay between the two communities has in this waybeen developed and maintained over time. Another factor is the building of networks. The strong during these four decades of the Convention is built on emissions in a cost-effective way. FUTURE CHALLENGES New approaches necessary International air pollution control is by many considered as a success story. However, the success is in many ways and development /C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en 123Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 859 industrialised countries (including Japan and Australia), where emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, VOCs, and some other compounds have been decreasedsigniﬁcantly (Maas and Grennfelt 2016 ). But even in the areas, where air pollution has been a top priority for several decades, air pollution remains a problem. Ecosystemeffects, which were the main reason for the establishment of the Convention, are to some extent reduced, but the emissions of ammonia have so far only been reduced by20–30% in Europe and even less in North America. Looking at health effects, it is difﬁcult to talk about suc- cess, when hundreds of thousands of inhabitants on bothcontinents are predicted to meet an earlier death due to air pollution. But the problem is even larger and more urgent when looking outside the traditional industrialised world. The focus is today on the large urban regions in the countries that are facing rapid population growth and industrialisation.Although large efforts now are being made to decrease sul- phur emissions in China—the world’s leading sulphur emitter—major challenges remain. In India and several othercountries, sulphur emissions are still increasing. Estimates airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/ ). It is assumed that ﬁne particles (PM2.5) are a main cause for the health effects. The new and great challenge is therefore to control air pol-lution in relation to health risks, in particular by decreasing exposure to the small particles. There is, however, a risk that control measures will only concentrations of particles have occurred during recentyears. At ﬁrst, these episodes were considered to be caused essentially by local emissions. More thorough analysis has, however, shown that they were to a large extent caused byregional emissions and buildup of high concentrations over Similar situations are also often encountered in urban are, as previously mentioned, also linked to interconti- nental and hemispheric scales. It is also obvious that the research communities within together. Health aspects are of importance both from airpollution and climate change perspectives, and heat wavescarry poor air quality as winds are often very low and the atmospheric boundary layer stagnant. During heat waves, and impacts on radiation balances. Modelling is a scientiﬁcarea where much progress has been made and where has allowed integration of atmospheric chemistry into theclimate models formulated as Earth system models, cou- simultaneously. The modelling approach can be further developed when observations are designed to map Earthsystem component boundaries to understand and quantify the ﬂows and interactions between different compartments, global-scale concepts such as ‘‘planetary boundaries’’ and ‘‘trajectories of the Earth system vs. planetary thresholds’’have been developed (Rockstro ¨m et al. 2009 ; Steffen et al. 2018 ). Solutions are available; driving forces and investments are lacking In 2016, the Air Convention launched a scientiﬁc report situation within the UNECE region was updated (Maas andGrennfelt 2016 ). The report also presented future chal- lems. It also showed that solutions are available for most ofthe identiﬁed problems at affordable costs below the health and ecosystem beneﬁts of the control actions. Even if solutions are available, many parts of the world are facing large problems in implementing them. There are several reasons, but often there is a lack of knowledge and resources. This is particularly true in many developingcountries. Another reason is the lack of political interest. Air pollution is still not of top priority among politicians, even if there is overwhelming evidence that air pollution isone of the most common causes of shortened life (e.g., industry and agriculture) are forming strong lobbyingforces delaying actions. 123/C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en860 Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 Air pollution is a problem that cannot be seen in isola- will be a win–win solution.

Policy development is no longer limited ten cause of premature deaths in the world has given high Additional initiatives are taken by other organisations, suchas the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the weather and climate observations, research and services, and it is rapidly developing its regional and global capac-ities in Earth system observations, modelling, and predic- threats and for global use. The research is done in largeprogrammes like Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) and if the starting point and modes of action can be different,all initiatives are aiming for the same goal, cleaner air. It is tional Law Commission, under which a proposal for a Lawfor the Protection of the Atmosphere has been prepared (http://legal.un.org/ilc/summaries/8_8.shtml ) but in the current international atmosphere there is a lack of politicalsupport to implement it. Our hope is that the situation will change soon—the initiative is too important to fail. The UN has put forward a very strong agenda in order to pollution is an integral part of several of the SGDs, like water. Climate change is a very signiﬁcant common and cross-cutting factor. The Air Convention has taken some steps in promoting well-developed structure, it has taken a role of making surethat international organisations having air pollution on its agenda are aware of each other and to invite to further collaboration and development. Initiatives are taken bothwithin the formal Convention structure and through dedi- which has proven successful in linking scientiﬁc evidence, monitoring, and integrated assessment modelling directed These new international initiatives have a strong emphasis on policy development. The experience from the50 years of international air pollution development is the value of well-deﬁned scientiﬁc objectives and activities supporting policy. The increased interest from WHO andUN Environment is welcome and there are expectations of situation in many parts of the world. However, for theseorganisations, air pollution is just one of several priority organisations are likely able to set up advanced infras-tructures with respect to emission inventories, monitoring, and its components, air pollution being an important part.This is in line with the WMO strategic plan and with fast tres like The European Centre for Medium Range WeatherForecast (ECMWF).

There is also a need to mobilise new generations of scientists, scientists that are willing to cross boundaries andfocus on thematic problems and to build legitimacy among policymakers (e.g. Bouma 2016 ). Today we have more ence. It is also important to mobilise new generations ofdedicated policymakers. Unfortunately, we also see that politicians often are questioning science and seeing science which hopefully will not occur in the future. Instead wehope that it was an eye-opener and that industry instead can cleaner atmosphere. FINAL REMARKS industry, and the public worked together, the basis wasformed for the successful control of, what was considered, of the last century. We learnt from experience that science-based policy advice worked well when the best available knowledge was provided, and used to understand the speciﬁc problems, generate, and evaluate the policy optionsand monitor the outcomes of policy implementation.However, the world does not look the same today, and there are lessons to be learnt. Most important is thebuilding of mutual trust between science advisers and policymakers, and that both communities are honest about advice works best when it is guided by the ideal of co - tists and policymakers (SAPEA 2019 ).

In conducting the review, speciﬁc objectives were portance for air quality policy. The original concept of this review was borne at the International Conference outdoor sources. There is a growing need to have integrated air pollution and related observations from both ground-based and remote sensing instruments, including in particular those on satellites. The research should also capitalize on the growing area of low-cost sensors, while ensuring a quality of the measurements which are are signiﬁcant feedbacks, such as those related to aerosols, chemistry, and meteorology.

The introduction of the automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS), long-range identiﬁcation and tracking (LRIT), and vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) have enabled tracking of individual ships in unprecedented detail. These navigational local and global scales. Currently, ship emission models using AIS data as an ac- tivity source are most popular. They can have accurate infor- models. Ship emission data are available on a global grid new routes in the Arctic. and departure following the same AIS-based approach as for at berth are estimated based on ship type and size, but with to comply with at least three options. The ﬁrst of these is fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment systems, which are commonly used (estuaries, ports) or water exchange is slow (e.g. the Baltic Sea) (Teuchies et al., 2020).

Methane, methanol, and ammonia are three fuels which three fuels are also suitable for use in internal combustion engines as well as fuel cells.

(2018) reported that there is a severe lack of epidemi- ological studies investigating the health impacts originating they pointed out that there is no clear distinction between PM thus, there is a limited number of studies assessing the re- spective health impacts. portance of the more advanced measures (in addition to PMmass fractions) are to some extent inconclusive. One reason for this uncertainty is that there are so many associations of pact of PM is the associated oxidative stress when the parti- cles are inhaled (e.g. see Gao et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). A possible explanation for the health effects from PM is based (Gao et al., 2020). One prominent emerging area is the evaluation of long- term, multi-decadal concentrations and meteorology on a sufﬁcient spatial resolution. Long-term and lifetime expo- sures are known to be more important in terms of human health, compared with short-term exposures. Comprehensive data sets are therefore needed, which will include multi- sets have already been reported (Kukkonen et al., 2018; Sid- et al., 2020; Siddika et al., 2020).

Sim- strategies, the changes are not assessed or monetized.

A possibility is to use the same ap- proach as with air pollution; i.e. estimate the marginal dam- does not lead to useful results. Uncertainties are too high and timation of impacts. An alternative approach to estimating marginal damage costs is to use marginal abatement costs. A basic law of envi- ronmental economics is that for pollution control a pareto- age costs (MDCs) are equal to marginal abatement costs (MACs). Thus, if MAC at the pareto-optimal state are known, they could be used instead of the MDCs. However, the pareto-optimal state is not known if MDCs are not known. But one could use an environmental aim that is universally optimal solution in the view of society and then estimate the MACs to reach this aim, which is then used for the assess- ment. This approach was ﬁrst proposed by Baumol and Oates (1971). so-called Paris Agreement, which was agreed on at the 2015 by a large number of countries, the most important aim was could be used as the basis for generating MACs. Bachmann (2020) has carried out a literature research of MDCs and MACs for GHG emissions.

Secondly, the marginal avoidance costs per tonne of avoided carbon are re- duced, especially for the period 2020–2035. The reason is later more expensive measures like producing and using fu- els that are produced from renewable electricity (power to X) will have a lower effect on air pollution reduction. In the following an example is shown where an efﬁcient cli-mate protection measure gets inefﬁcient if air pollution is in- cluded in the assessment. This example is the use of small wood ﬁrings in cities. Wood ﬁrings are climate friendly but that for wood ﬁrings that are operated in cities, the damage of gas emissions.

There are of course cross-cutting needs that are a prerequisite to further air quality research and de- dations for further research. There is a progressively important need to move from static annual inventories to those that are dynamic in terms of activ- ity patterns and of higher temporal resolution. This is driven and because there is an increasing availability of online ob- munity efforts are necessary for identifying and reducing un- certainties in emissions that have a large impact on the result- from source apportionment methods. One gap is the evaluation of agricultural emissions, which are still poorly understood, and improvements will support co-beneﬁts. While considerable effort has been devoted to es- timating NO xemissions, there are still uncertainties in the es- timation of VOC emissions. These uncertainties have direct contributions from secondary organic aerosols to regional ties is the estimation of VOC proﬁles in terms of the chemi- a shift has occurred to both low-sulfur and carbon-neutral or non-carbon fuels. airborne non-exhaust emissions is becoming more and more cles.

In this paper, which is based on an international symposium organised tocommemorate 50 years of successful integration of air characteristics of the science–policy interactions, such as the critical loads concept and the large-scale ecosystemﬁeld studies. Finally, acid rain and air pollution are set in scientiﬁc infrastructures.

Eight protocols have been signed under the Air of all key air pollutants have been reduced signiﬁcantly andfor the most important acidifying compound, sulphur dioxide, emissions in Europe have decreased by 80% or policy interaction perspective, based on a Symposium in development. The Symposium involved both a testimony of what we have learned and how the experience can be used in the future.

Gorham’s researches,like those of Smith a century before, were met by what at large. It was not until 1967 and 1968 when Svante Oden Committee Report (Ode ´n1968 ) that the acid rain problem was brought to both public and scientiﬁc considerations.The report included a huge body of scientiﬁc and policy- relevant evidence that long-distance transport and deposi- tion of acidifying pollutants were causing signiﬁcant environmental and ecological impacts, even in countries authors. The report included a broad environmentalassessment of the sulphur emission problem including sources, atmospheric and surface water chemistry, and included scenarios and estimated costs for environmental damage and control; in fact it was probably the ﬁrst full systems analysis of an environmental problem. In the report, a ﬁrst estimate was made of the relative were also made of the effects of sulphur emissions on 14r1.pdf ) regional air pollution was explicitly mentioned research, Nordforsk, was asked to plan and developmethodologies for the investigation.

Further studies have supported the role and for the ﬁrst time particulate matter was included in aninternational protocol (Reis et al. 2012 ). 1999, it was realised that for some pollutants under the AirConvention, emission control needed to be considered over alone. Ozone was of particular importance, since long-termobjectives in the form of critical levels and public health Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) was set upunder the Convention in 2004, with a primary objective to quantify the intercontinental transport of pollutants. The Climate change has for more than a decade become an acidity. Such maps have played an important role for illustrating outcomes of future policies as well as of actions taken (from Maas and Grennfelt 2016 ) Fig. 5 Links between sources and effects used as an illustration in the 123/C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en854 Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 policy.

SLCPs thus also includecompounds that are cooling the atmosphere, i.e. small secondary aerosols, e.g. sulphate particles. Recent research has focused on a better understanding of these compounds’contribution to both air pollution and climate as well as on Sand et al. 2016 ). Reactive nitrogen species are another group of com- of the century. Around 2006 several initiatives were takenin Europe, including a special task force on Reactive was considered both as a traditional atmospheric pollutant molecular nitrogen again, was introduced (Galloway et al.2003 ). The studies have pointed to the importance of the driver, and monitoring programmes were set up both in the National Atmospheric Deposition programme (NADP) started in 1976 and is still running. Both countries have taken part in the Air Convention activities and have signedmost of the protocols and achieved decreases in SO 2 emissions of the order of 80% between 1980 and 2015. TheUS has however taken a different approach with respect topolicy in comparison to Europe. Instead of developing a strategy based on integrated assessment modelling, it was INTERACTIONS rain and transboundary air pollution that have become effects to ecosystems), development of bridging concepts that have served the implementation of strategies, andﬁnally the dynamics in the science–policy interactions. ecosystem effects has been a key for understanding thecauses, impact, and trends in acid rain, both in Europe and (Table 2). The original EMEP network has since the start system. The originally established simple monitoring sta- tions have over time been complemented with moreadvanced monitoring, and some stations are today advanced atmospheric chemistry platforms with continuous collection of a multitude of atmospheric parameters (Fig. 6). The EMEP database is nowadays widely used for modelling. EMEP has also become a model for monitoring networks related to other geographical regions, conven-tions, and purposes. One example is the acid deposition monitoring network in East Asia (EANET). It is obvious that having a qualiﬁed centre for data collection and stor-age, standardisation, and intercalibration of methods has open nature is part of the success. The ﬁnancial support toEMEP, regulated through a separate protocol, has been monitoring activities. EMEP and was organised through so-called InternationalCooperative Programmes (ICPs).

The concept, ﬁrst discussed in 1982, was taken from the original idea to application quite quickly duringthe 1980s. The Swedish expert Jan Nilsson was a key makers, the concept gained the legitimacy on which poli-cies were developed. According to Jan Nilsson, it all have a sounder base for emission control, something thatcould express the long-term objectives for emission control policies. The concept was ﬁrst met by scepticism, not least loads were included in the plans for the next rounds of thesulphur and nitrogen protocols in 1988, it changed the way the Air Convention operated.

From the strategies strictly directed at ecosystem effects, the approach is now All the bridging concepts are to varying degrees it is important to keep transparency and conﬁdence in the underlying data and to scientiﬁcally evaluate and scrutinisethem. This is particularly important for the IAMs, which are the ﬁnal step in a chain of inputs (Fig. 8). The models have often been criticised, not least from industry and otherstakeholders that are questioning the priorities that result model calculations, has, however, been transparent, andcountries and stakeholders have always had the option to their own negotiation positions. Forming science–policy credibility crucially important to maintain scientiﬁc credibility. The close involvement of scientists has been a signature of the Air Convention. Scientists have always had a role at thepolicy meetings, communicating results from basic scien- a way that has been understandable and useful for thepolicy work. The role of the scientists has been as honest and observations of new problems have also been impor- tant, and have resulted in repeated changes in the framingsof the Air Convention to adapt to new situations: going interplay between the two communities has in this waybeen developed and maintained over time. Another factor is the building of networks. The strong during these four decades of the Convention is built on emissions in a cost-effective way. FUTURE CHALLENGES New approaches necessary International air pollution control is by many considered as a success story. However, the success is in many ways and development /C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en 123Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 859 industrialised countries (including Japan and Australia), where emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, VOCs, and some other compounds have been decreasedsigniﬁcantly (Maas and Grennfelt 2016 ). But even in the areas, where air pollution has been a top priority for several decades, air pollution remains a problem. Ecosystemeffects, which were the main reason for the establishment of the Convention, are to some extent reduced, but the emissions of ammonia have so far only been reduced by20–30% in Europe and even less in North America. Looking at health effects, it is difﬁcult to talk about suc- cess, when hundreds of thousands of inhabitants on bothcontinents are predicted to meet an earlier death due to air pollution. But the problem is even larger and more urgent when looking outside the traditional industrialised world. The focus is today on the large urban regions in the countries that are facing rapid population growth and industrialisation.Although large efforts now are being made to decrease sul- phur emissions in China—the world’s leading sulphur emitter—major challenges remain. In India and several othercountries, sulphur emissions are still increasing. Estimates airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/ ). It is assumed that ﬁne particles (PM2.5) are a main cause for the health effects. The new and great challenge is therefore to control air pol-lution in relation to health risks, in particular by decreasing exposure to the small particles. There is, however, a risk that control measures will only concentrations of particles have occurred during recentyears. At ﬁrst, these episodes were considered to be caused essentially by local emissions. More thorough analysis has, however, shown that they were to a large extent caused byregional emissions and buildup of high concentrations over Similar situations are also often encountered in urban are, as previously mentioned, also linked to interconti- nental and hemispheric scales. It is also obvious that the research communities within together. Health aspects are of importance both from airpollution and climate change perspectives, and heat wavescarry poor air quality as winds are often very low and the atmospheric boundary layer stagnant. During heat waves, and impacts on radiation balances. Modelling is a scientiﬁcarea where much progress has been made and where has allowed integration of atmospheric chemistry into theclimate models formulated as Earth system models, cou- simultaneously. The modelling approach can be further developed when observations are designed to map Earthsystem component boundaries to understand and quantify the ﬂows and interactions between different compartments, global-scale concepts such as ‘‘planetary boundaries’’ and ‘‘trajectories of the Earth system vs. planetary thresholds’’have been developed (Rockstro ¨m et al. 2009 ; Steffen et al. 2018 ). Solutions are available; driving forces and investments are lacking In 2016, the Air Convention launched a scientiﬁc report situation within the UNECE region was updated (Maas andGrennfelt 2016 ). The report also presented future chal- lems. It also showed that solutions are available for most ofthe identiﬁed problems at affordable costs below the health and ecosystem beneﬁts of the control actions. Even if solutions are available, many parts of the world are facing large problems in implementing them. There are several reasons, but often there is a lack of knowledge and resources. This is particularly true in many developingcountries. Another reason is the lack of political interest. Air pollution is still not of top priority among politicians, even if there is overwhelming evidence that air pollution isone of the most common causes of shortened life (e.g., industry and agriculture) are forming strong lobbyingforces delaying actions. 123/C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en860 Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 Air pollution is a problem that cannot be seen in isola- will be a win–win solution.

It is tional Law Commission, under which a proposal for a Lawfor the Protection of the Atmosphere has been prepared (http://legal.un.org/ilc/summaries/8_8.shtml ) but in the current international atmosphere there is a lack of politicalsupport to implement it. Our hope is that the situation will change soon—the initiative is too important to fail. The UN has put forward a very strong agenda in order to pollution is an integral part of several of the SGDs, like water. Climate change is a very signiﬁcant common and cross-cutting factor. The Air Convention has taken some steps in promoting well-developed structure, it has taken a role of making surethat international organisations having air pollution on its agenda are aware of each other and to invite to further collaboration and development. Initiatives are taken bothwithin the formal Convention structure and through dedi- which has proven successful in linking scientiﬁc evidence, monitoring, and integrated assessment modelling directed These new international initiatives have a strong emphasis on policy development. The experience from the50 years of international air pollution development is the value of well-deﬁned scientiﬁc objectives and activities supporting policy. The increased interest from WHO andUN Environment is welcome and there are expectations of situation in many parts of the world. However, for theseorganisations, air pollution is just one of several priority organisations are likely able to set up advanced infras-tructures with respect to emission inventories, monitoring, and its components, air pollution being an important part.This is in line with the WMO strategic plan and with fast tres like The European Centre for Medium Range WeatherForecast (ECMWF).

Today we have more ence. It is also important to mobilise new generations ofdedicated policymakers. Unfortunately, we also see that politicians often are questioning science and seeing science which hopefully will not occur in the future. Instead wehope that it was an eye-opener and that industry instead can cleaner atmosphere. FINAL REMARKS industry, and the public worked together, the basis wasformed for the successful control of, what was considered, of the last century. We learnt from experience that science-based policy advice worked well when the best available knowledge was provided, and used to understand the speciﬁc problems, generate, and evaluate the policy optionsand monitor the outcomes of policy implementation.However, the world does not look the same today, and there are lessons to be learnt. Most important is thebuilding of mutual trust between science advisers and policymakers, and that both communities are honest about advice works best when it is guided by the ideal of co - tists and policymakers (SAPEA 2019 ).

The latest estimate from the WHO reported that in 2012, approximately 3.7 million people died from outdoor urban and rural sources(WHO 2014 ). The cause of deaths was broken down as follows: ischaemic heart disease (40 %), stroke are based not only on a greater understanding of thediseases caused by poor air quality, but also more accurate exposure assessment that utilises sophisti- cated measurement and modelling technology. Ofnote, the overall mortality estimate more than doubles deaths stem from cardiovascular disease. is found in the low- and middle-income countries of the developing nations of these areas. However, theproblem is very much a global one. Focusing on Europe, air pollution is again the biggest environment countries were estimated at 203,000 and 280,000,respectively (WHO 2014 ). In recent years (2010–2012) the proportion of the urban population 10 and PM 2.5concentrations exceeded that was 21 and EU urban population exposure to PM concentrations above the WHO AQG (WHO 2006 ) is signiﬁcantly peans is reduced, on average, by about 8.6 monthsowing to PM 2.5pollution (WHO 2013b ), whilst traditional health impact assessment methods used in 123 concentrations were reduced to the WHO AQG annual level (Fig. 2). signiﬁcant contribution to mortality. Current (2008)data estimate that if the effect of PM 2.5air pollution is considered by itself, it is responsible for at least UK, with mortality rate estimates from long-term PM London boroughs (PHE 2014 ). Upon comparing commonly acknowledged mortality risks, it has been estimated that a 10 lg/m3reduction in ambient PM 2.5pollution (roughly equivalent to eradicating all anthropogenic particles) would have a larger endpoints has been subject to intense study, resulting 2.5and PM 10, with nega- tive impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health following both short-term and chronic exposures.Furthermore, data strongly suggest that effects have no 2.5background concentration–response function (WHO 2013a ).

Improved air quality and improved health We now also have consistent evidence that a reduction sustained intervention (mainly regulatory actions) is associated with improvements in public health. In theUSA, Pope et al. ( 2009 ) used data from the 51 cities long-term PM 2.5data are available. It was reported that reduction in PM 2.5concentration between 1980 and 2000 was strongly associated with 2.7 year overallincreases in life expectancy that occurred during that period (Fig. 3). Evidence has also been demonstrated 2002—a period when the annual average PM 10 concentration decreased by 5–6 lg/m3. This reduction in particle levels was associated with attenuation in theannual rate of decline of lung function (Downs et al. 2007 ). Using the same cohort, Schindler et al. ( 2009 ) 123 10 was associated with improved respiratory health(reduced incidence of chronic cough, bronchitis,common cold, nocturnal dry cough and conjunctivitis health of the Swiss children occurred following optimal air quality management.

InLondon, particulate pollution is predominantly diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) mixed with resuspended many characteristics of PM have the potential toinﬂuence the toxicity of ambient PM.

Black carbon 2013a ), the health effects of BC particles have also initiatives have conﬁrmed that sufﬁcient epidemio- logical evidence exists to link short-term (daily) admissions. Evidence is also conclusive that long- term (annual) BC exposure is associated with all-causeand cardiopulmonary mortality. Although distinct mechanistic effects have not been identiﬁed from toxicological studies, suggesting that BC may not be adirect toxic component of ﬁne PM, it is hypothesised beyond. Furthermore, in that short-term studies showthat health effect associations with BC were more robust than those with PM 2.5or PM 10, although BC particles may not constitute a causal agent, it is theopinion that they may well serve as a better indicator of harmful particulate substances (e.g. organics) from Organic carbonOC is a very complex and heterogenous mixture of As a consequence, it is a huge challenge to identify thepotential toxicity of speciﬁc OC constituents and in fact evidence is currently insufﬁcient to distinguish between the toxicity of primary and secondary organicaerosols. Studies are, however, generating increasing endpoints. Ostro et al. ( 2010 ) has also observed associations between long-term exposure to organic monary mortality. Inorganic secondary aerosols Epidemiological evidence continues to accumulate on the short-term effects of sulphate on cardiovascular 2012 ).

Data, however, are not Ultraﬁne particlesUFPs (smaller than 0.1 lm) have many unique properties that have led scientists to hypothesise thatthis size fraction may have speciﬁc or enhanced toxicity relative to ﬁne (PM 2.5) or coarse PM.

In addition to trafﬁc density per se, it is not surprising thereforethat the greatest health impacts appear to be associated to humans based on sufﬁcient evidence that it is linked 123 toxicity and health consequences of roadside PM have focused on DEPs, the non-exhaust sources are attract- health effects is largely ignored at the regulatory level Riediker et al. 2004 ). Mechanisms of PM toxicity The well-established evidence that PM pollution contributes to an array of health outcomes has resulted mechanistic pathways. Although there remains much short- and long-term PM 2.5exposure with mortality and morbidity has evolved rapidly and continues to doso. For example, in investigating subclinical physio- logical changes, epidemiological research has ﬁbrinogen—subtle responses that have been consis- to study mechanistic pathways and physiological endpoints related to adverse effects following DEPexposure is the use of controlled exposure studies in environmentally relevant DE exposure experiments, combined with cardiovascular measurements, BAL and bronchial biopsy have revealed well-deﬁnedsystemic, pulmonary and cardiac responses involving a variety of cellular and molecular perturbations. It is probable that associations between the various con-stituents of PM and health effects are the result of nisms. Current evidence does, however, support a tion, translocation of particle constituents and an cardiovascular and obstructive pulmonary diseases (Kelly and Fussell 2015 ; Fig. 4).

If people are aware of variations in the such awareness has the potential to create a cleaner environment and a healthier population. Studies and initiatives examining public awareness and understanding in this area have yielded mixed warnings associated with ground level O 3do have a air quality. Bell et al. ( 2004 ) have also hypothesised induced mortality observed across US communities.Other research has concluded that both awareness of understanding of air quality information are lackingamongst the public (Bickerstaff and Walker 2001 ; European Commission (EC) conducted a ﬂash Euro-barometer to gain a greater insight into the views of the disorders, cardiovascular diseases and asthma/allergy were 87, 92 and 87 % respectively. Factors determining awareness Other than the availability of sufﬁcient information governing how aware individuals are about the quality Fig. 4 Biological pathways linking PM exposure withoxidative and inﬂammatory pathways in the lung and cardiovasculature640 Environ Geochem Health (2015) 37:631–649 123 are likely to include understanding, perception and a standing of what is undoubtedly a complex science. Unlike other environmental risks that are routinelycommunicated such as UV and heat, overall air quality encompasses several primary pollutants as well as secondary products owing to atmospheric transforma-tion. Rural areas for example are very often considered times, O concentrations of nitrogen oxides to sequester rural O3. A lack of vested interest in the topic is also possible amongst ‘healthy’ people, less likely to have pollution and/or increasing medication may bring.Indeed, where research has indicated that individuals are aware of air quality warnings and take responsive actions, larger responses were observed for moresusceptible groups or carers thereof (McDermott et al. is another factor inﬂuencing the public understanding data generated by monitoring sites and communicated via an advisory service (Shooter and Brimblecombe2009 ). Several studies have investigated the relation- ship between perceived and measured outdoor air (Atari et al. 2009 ), others have found little or no rather than the advisory service, drove the response.Some epidemiological researchers have also indicated that self-reported health status is associated with et al. 2008 ).Information services Public awareness is fundamentally dependent upon optimal air pollution monitoring, forecasting and reporting. Many countries have air quality monitoringnetworks that are structured around a particular country’s regulatory obligation to report monitored lutants, air quality modelling systems and meteoro- logical data are also processed to create a national airquality index (AQI). Again in line with national legislation, an AQI communicates pollution levels and short term; Table 1). These data are used by the public Another information tool is provided by accessible air tion events via a computer/tablet (websites, email, social media) or phone (texts, apps) (London AirQuality Network; City of London). These are becom- ing increasingly informative and engaging, allowing example, providing low pollution journey planners to reduce exposure (Fig. 5). New developments Whilst monitoring, forecasting and reporting of air quality have become increasingly sophisticated and 123 systems sourced by ﬁxed site monitoring stations are monitors was primarily limited to industries associ- children (Spira-Cohen et al. 2011 ). Now we are witnessing an emerging role for inexpensive, portable, easy-to-use personal monitoring devices (Austen by such sensors is not currently robust enough to compliment data for ofﬁcial monitoring networks, there is undoubtedly a need for more dynamicmeasures of time-activity patterns in relation to low-cost air quality sensors, also has the potential to Added to their ubiquitous technology, the penetrationof these phones is unrivalled in demographics, possibilities in the communication of individual research setting, novel smartphone-based software that records people’s movements and physical activitylevels in the urban environment and is integrated with spatial–temporal maps of air pollution is already being Discussion fore that health effects of PM—one of the pollutantsdeemed most dangerous to health—are well docu- mented.

DEPs are nowclassiﬁed as carcinogenic, and an increasing number of studies are investigating the potential for particulate We now also appreciate that there is no evidence of a studies are showing associations between PM and 2.5. Correspondingly, reductions in population exposure to air pollution appreciable beneﬁts in terms of increased life expectancy and improvements to respiratory health. Having ﬁrmly established associations between ambient PM and adverse health effects, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is inambient PM that affects health—information that in characteristics or sources to be deﬁnitely identiﬁed comparing and synthesising data from existing studies is therefore needed before concluding thatadditional indicators (be they BC or UFPs) have a toxicity by identifying pathways that ultimately link obstructive pulmonary diseases. 123 Evidence has emerged that (a) the burden of ambient PM pollution on health is signiﬁcant at relatively low concentrations, (b) there is no safelower limit and (c) effects follow a mostly linear concentration–response function, suggesting that pub- lic health beneﬁts will result from any reduction inconcentrations. As has been advocated many times before, interventions to reduce levels of particulate ment (environment, transport, energy, health, housing) related particulates means that forward-looking and integrated transport policies are critical for theimprovement of urban environments. Trafﬁc must be investment in clean and affordable public transport vehicles, lowering speed limits and enhancing cycle routes.

New techniques are also being developed with the capacity such on-board monitoring systems is the on-board fuel con- sumption measurement (OBFCM) device which is already mandatory for new light-duty vehicles and is being extended emissions inventories. 3.2.4 Shipping emissions the 0.5 % sulfur cap in 2020, and typically are not equipped routes are frequently located in the vicinity of the coast, The environmental regulation concerning the sulfur emis- sions from ships has been in place in the Baltic Sea since North America and some Chinese coastal areas have strin- high-sulfur fuel in ships was allowed until the start of 2020, when sulfur reductions of a maximum of 0.5 % S were ex- tended to all ships (IMO, 2019). This has been estimated to al., 2018). Nitrogen oxide emissions from ships are regulated NOxreduction. The introduction of the automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS), long-range identiﬁcation and tracking (LRIT), and vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) have enabled tracking of individual ships in unprecedented detail. These navigational local and global scales. Currently, ship emission models using AIS data as an ac- tivity source are most popular. They can have accurate infor- models. Ship emission data are available on a global grid new routes in the Arctic. and departure following the same AIS-based approach as for at berth are estimated based on ship type and size, but with to comply with at least three options. The ﬁrst of these is fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment systems, which are commonly used (estuaries, ports) or water exchange is slow (e.g. the Baltic Sea) (Teuchies et al., 2020). The use of low-sulfur or LNG fuels is a fossil-based solu- tion, unless the fuel was made using renewable or fully syn- much on the engine type selected. Methane, methanol, and ammonia are three fuels which three fuels are also suitable for use in internal combustion engines as well as fuel cells. All three are hydrogen carri- els and have hydrogen production as an intermediary step. This could offer a viable pathway towards hydrogen-based existing fuel infrastructure (DNV-GL, 2019). 3.2.5 Emissions of indoor sources dividual exposure to pollutants, which is described later in is needed.

Different methods are used for source ap- portionment of ambient concentrations, each including cer- cases these methods are complementary to each other, and creases the uncertainties (Thunis et al., 2019).

This approach is based on the assumptions that the regional contribution is constant at regional background. The CMB is based on known source composition proﬁles and measured receptor species concen- source proﬁles, which ideally are from the region where the receptor is located and that should be contemporary with the underpinning ambient air measurements.

(iii) Research recommendations for deciphering the impacts of various particulate matter properties which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. et al. (2018) reported that there is a severe lack of epidemi- ological studies investigating the health impacts originating they pointed out that there is no clear distinction between PM thus, there is a limited number of studies assessing the re- spective health impacts. portance of the more advanced measures (in addition to PMmass fractions) are to some extent inconclusive. One reason for this uncertainty is that there are so many associations of pact of PM is the associated oxidative stress when the parti- cles are inhaled (e.g. see Gao et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). A possible explanation for the health effects from PM is based (Gao et al., 2020). One prominent emerging area is the evaluation of long- term, multi-decadal concentrations and meteorology on a sufﬁcient spatial resolution. Long-term and lifetime expo- sures are known to be more important in terms of human health, compared with short-term exposures. Comprehensive data sets are therefore needed, which will include multi- sets have already been reported (Kukkonen et al., 2018; Sid- et al., 2020; Siddika et al., 2020).

Clearly, indoor pollution sources also inﬂuence exposure. It is therefore important to assess possibilities to reduce the tory use of inserts in open ﬁreplaces.

Sim- strategies, the changes are not assessed or monetized. An exception is the UK, where estimations of the “social costs of carbon” are used in assessments (Watkiss and Down- ommends using a carbon price of GBP 69 per tonne of CO 2;eq at 2018 prices. emissions be monetized? A possibility is to use the same ap- proach as with air pollution; i.e. estimate the marginal dam- does not lead to useful results. Uncertainties are too high and timation of impacts. An alternative approach to estimating marginal damage costs is to use marginal abatement costs. A basic law of envi- ronmental economics is that for pollution control a pareto- age costs (MDCs) are equal to marginal abatement costs (MACs). Thus, if MAC at the pareto-optimal state are known, they could be used instead of the MDCs. However, the pareto-optimal state is not known if MDCs are not known. But one could use an environmental aim that is universally optimal solution in the view of society and then estimate the MACs to reach this aim, which is then used for the assess- ment. This approach was ﬁrst proposed by Baumol and Oates (1971). so-called Paris Agreement, which was agreed on at the 2015 by a large number of countries, the most important aim was could be used as the basis for generating MACs. Bachmann (2020) has carried out a literature research of MDCs and MACs for GHG emissions.

Secondly, the marginal avoidance costs per tonne of avoided carbon are re- duced, especially for the period 2020–2035. The reason is later more expensive measures like producing and using fu- els that are produced from renewable electricity (power to X) will have a lower effect on air pollution reduction. In the following an example is shown where an efﬁcient cli-mate protection measure gets inefﬁcient if air pollution is in- cluded in the assessment. This example is the use of small wood ﬁrings in cities. Wood ﬁrings are climate friendly but that for wood ﬁrings that are operated in cities, the damage of gas emissions.

There are of course cross-cutting needs that are a prerequisite to further air quality research and de- dations for further research. There is a progressively important need to move from static annual inventories to those that are dynamic in terms of activ- ity patterns and of higher temporal resolution. This is driven and because there is an increasing availability of online ob- munity efforts are necessary for identifying and reducing un- certainties in emissions that have a large impact on the result- from source apportionment methods. One gap is the evaluation of agricultural emissions, which are still poorly understood, and improvements will support co-beneﬁts. While considerable effort has been devoted to es- timating NO xemissions, there are still uncertainties in the es- timation of VOC emissions. These uncertainties have direct contributions from secondary organic aerosols to regional ties is the estimation of VOC proﬁles in terms of the chemi- a shift has occurred to both low-sulfur and carbon-neutral or non-carbon fuels. airborne non-exhaust emissions is becoming more and more cles.

The motivation is growing for an inter-disciplinary approach to assess exposure and the mote sensing measurements, including satellite data, with atmospheric chemical transport and urban-scale dispersion modelling. timescales. PM, which is one of the most health-relevant air pollutants, is associated with many health effects, such as all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and Stafoggia et al., 2013; Weinmayr et al., 2010). There have concentrations (PNCs), secondary organic PM, primary PM, metals, and toxic or hazardous pollutants. ponents has also stimulated further debate on the optimal concentration–response functions and on the necessity of (about 374 000 premature deaths) were linked to exposure PM 2:5exposure may have been considerably underestimated.

This has been Some recent studies (e.g. Schmid et al., 2019) have provided evidence on the advantages of using costs and beneﬁts for grated assessments. fuel for ships has been reduced to 0.5 % worldwide (IMO, 2019). The EURO 6d norm has led to a signiﬁcant reduction Council has recently (in September 2020) agreed to reduce fossil fuels. However, there is one exception: small wood (e.g. Kukkonen et al., 2020b).

Fussell let alone the health-based World Health Organisation has been a substantial increase in ﬁndings that particulate matter (PM) air pollution is not only points, but is also associated with a broader number of disease outcomes. Data strongly suggest that effects have no threshold within the studied range of ambient background concentrations and that they follow a mostly linear concentration–response function. Hav- ing ﬁrmly established this signiﬁcant public health problem, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is in ambient PM that affects health and to understand the underlying biological basis of toxicity by identifying mechanistic pathways—information toring, forecasting and reporting that exploits increas- ingly sophisticated information systems. Improving air quality is a considerable but not an intractable challenge. Translating the correct scientiﬁc evidence into bold, realistic and effective policies undisputedly has the potential to reduce air pollution so that it no health. awareness /C1Air quality communication Introduction Historical perspective Air pollution is now fully acknowledged to be a signiﬁcant public health problem, responsible for a growing range of health effects that are well docu- conducted in many regions of the world.

This in turn has led to a speculative link to the daily inhalation of smoke inconﬁned spaces from fuels used for warmth, cooking and lighting. Leaping forward through history to Victorian London, the billowing smoke and sulphur diox- ide (SO 2) from domestic and industrial coal burning, meteorological phenomenon as a spectacular mani- smog on sunlight gave London magniﬁcent breadth notoriously toxic air became a world-famous institu- stagnant weather conditions that trapped combustion 4000–12,000 deaths and an enormous increase in respiratory and cardiovascular complications (Logan1953 ; Bell and Davis 2001 ).

Modern-day air pollution On recounting such progress, it is especially disap- quality, not solely within the UK but in many urbanareas around the world, have miserably stalled. We build up—and it is during such episodes that suscep-tible individuals (e.g. those with asthma, COPD or heart disease) may undergo an acute exacerbation requiring increased medication or admission to hos-pital.

The latest estimate from the WHO reported that in 2012, approximately 3.7 million people died from outdoor urban and rural sources(WHO 2014 ). The cause of deaths was broken down as follows: ischaemic heart disease (40 %), stroke are based not only on a greater understanding of thediseases caused by poor air quality, but also more accurate exposure assessment that utilises sophisti- cated measurement and modelling technology. Ofnote, the overall mortality estimate more than doubles deaths stem from cardiovascular disease. is found in the low- and middle-income countries of the developing nations of these areas. However, theproblem is very much a global one. Focusing on Europe, air pollution is again the biggest environment countries were estimated at 203,000 and 280,000,respectively (WHO 2014 ). In recent years (2010–2012) the proportion of the urban population 10 and PM 2.5concentrations exceeded that was 21 and EU urban population exposure to PM concentrations above the WHO AQG (WHO 2006 ) is signiﬁcantly peans is reduced, on average, by about 8.6 monthsowing to PM 2.5pollution (WHO 2013b ), whilst traditional health impact assessment methods used in 123 concentrations were reduced to the WHO AQG annual level (Fig. 2). signiﬁcant contribution to mortality. Current (2008)data estimate that if the effect of PM 2.5air pollution is considered by itself, it is responsible for at least UK, with mortality rate estimates from long-term PM London boroughs (PHE 2014 ). Upon comparing commonly acknowledged mortality risks, it has been estimated that a 10 lg/m3reduction in ambient PM 2.5pollution (roughly equivalent to eradicating all anthropogenic particles) would have a larger endpoints has been subject to intense study, resulting 2.5and PM 10, with nega- tive impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health following both short-term and chronic exposures.Furthermore, data strongly suggest that effects have no 2.5background concentration–response function (WHO 2013a ).

We now have evidence linking long-term exposure to PM 2.5with adverse birth outcomes, whilst emerging data suggest possible effects of long-term PM 2.5exposure on diabetes, neurodevelopment, cog- nal exposure to air pollutants, including particulates, during pregnancy to various birth outcomes is steadilyincreasing and is of particular interest owing to the such, the potential to have long-term consequences onoverall health.

Improved air quality and improved health We now also have consistent evidence that a reduction sustained intervention (mainly regulatory actions) is associated with improvements in public health. In theUSA, Pope et al. ( 2009 ) used data from the 51 cities long-term PM 2.5data are available. It was reported that reduction in PM 2.5concentration between 1980 and 2000 was strongly associated with 2.7 year overallincreases in life expectancy that occurred during that period (Fig. 3). Evidence has also been demonstrated 2002—a period when the annual average PM 10 concentration decreased by 5–6 lg/m3. This reduction in particle levels was associated with attenuation in theannual rate of decline of lung function (Downs et al. 2007 ). Using the same cohort, Schindler et al. ( 2009 ) 123 10 was associated with improved respiratory health(reduced incidence of chronic cough, bronchitis,common cold, nocturnal dry cough and conjunctivitis health of the Swiss children occurred following optimal air quality management.

The ﬁndings discussed have arisen from theWHO REVIHAAP Project (Review of Evidence on HEI 2010 ,2013a ,b). Black carbon 2013a ), the health effects of BC particles have also initiatives have conﬁrmed that sufﬁcient epidemio- logical evidence exists to link short-term (daily) admissions. Evidence is also conclusive that long- term (annual) BC exposure is associated with all-causeand cardiopulmonary mortality. Although distinct mechanistic effects have not been identiﬁed from toxicological studies, suggesting that BC may not be adirect toxic component of ﬁne PM, it is hypothesised beyond. Furthermore, in that short-term studies showthat health effect associations with BC were more robust than those with PM 2.5or PM 10, although BC particles may not constitute a causal agent, it is theopinion that they may well serve as a better indicator of harmful particulate substances (e.g. organics) from Organic carbonOC is a very complex and heterogenous mixture of As a consequence, it is a huge challenge to identify thepotential toxicity of speciﬁc OC constituents and in fact evidence is currently insufﬁcient to distinguish between the toxicity of primary and secondary organicaerosols. Studies are, however, generating increasing endpoints. Ostro et al. ( 2010 ) has also observed associations between long-term exposure to organic monary mortality.

For example, the cations particles) may have an underlying toxic role or else particulate components (Oakes et al. 2012 ). Coarse PM Accumulating epidemiological evidence suggests that short-term exposures to coarse particles (between 2.5 and 10 lm) are associated with effects on adverse cardiovascular health, respiratory endpoints health, 123 variable as to whether such effect estimates are higher term effects of coarse PM are fewer and have reported no or limited evidence that this size fraction has an coarse and ﬁne PM have reported that coarse particles can be as toxic as PM 2.5on a mass basis (Graff et al. 2009 ; Wegesser et al. 2009 ). Data, however, are not Ultraﬁne particlesUFPs (smaller than 0.1 lm) have many unique properties that have led scientists to hypothesise thatthis size fraction may have speciﬁc or enhanced toxicity relative to ﬁne (PM 2.5) or coarse PM. Apart sites, on a mass basis, smaller particles have a much 2013b ). Epidemiological data, however, are still consistent evidence of adverse effects of UFPs 2.5’’ (HEI 2013b ). Toxicological studies have certainly advanced our understanding of fraction to adopt differential patterns of deposition, Source Many PM pollution sources, namely coal combustion, transport have been associated with different types of main source of urban pollution—road transport—is evidence was found to be suggestive of a causal total and cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular morbidity (HEI 2010 ). The PM components from road trafﬁc include plus non-exhaust sources that are often characterisedby elevated concentrations of transition metals (brake wear [copper, antimony], tyre abrasion [zinc], dust increased domestic market penetration of diesel engi- diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) contribute signiﬁ- cantly to the air shed in many of the world’s largestcities. DEPs have also been shown to have substantial DEPs have an aerodynamic diameter of \\1lm) of characteristics. For instance, DEPs have a highly polyaromatic hydrocarbons and quinones. In addition to trafﬁc density per se, it is not surprising thereforethat the greatest health impacts appear to be associated to humans based on sufﬁcient evidence that it is linked 123 toxicity and health consequences of roadside PM have focused on DEPs, the non-exhaust sources are attract- health effects is largely ignored at the regulatory level Riediker et al. 2004 ). Mechanisms of PM toxicity The well-established evidence that PM pollution contributes to an array of health outcomes has resulted mechanistic pathways. Although there remains much short- and long-term PM 2.5exposure with mortality and morbidity has evolved rapidly and continues to doso. For example, in investigating subclinical physio- logical changes, epidemiological research has ﬁbrinogen—subtle responses that have been consis- to study mechanistic pathways and physiological endpoints related to adverse effects following DEPexposure is the use of controlled exposure studies in environmentally relevant DE exposure experiments, combined with cardiovascular measurements, BAL and bronchial biopsy have revealed well-deﬁnedsystemic, pulmonary and cardiac responses involving a variety of cellular and molecular perturbations. It is probable that associations between the various con-stituents of PM and health effects are the result of nisms. Current evidence does, however, support a tion, translocation of particle constituents and an cardiovascular and obstructive pulmonary diseases (Kelly and Fussell 2015 ; Fig. 4). Since oxidative stress is widely believed to play a is regarded as an attractive exposure metric in our bid OP of ambient PM collected at busy roadside sites is enrichment of metals (copper, barium) linked with surrounding these ﬁndings is well founded in that they Oxidative stress is linked to several DNA lesions and (8oxodG) has now been validated to evaluate the DNA adduct levels in non-smoking workers have been 10in high-trafﬁc urban areas (Palli et al. 2008 ) and were potential for transplacental environmental exposures Public awareness and education That poor air quality can have such a signiﬁcant impact on human health is undisputed, and theEnviron Geochem Health (2015) 37:631–649 639 123 previous sections have drawn upon research conducted over recent years that supports the notion that risks are general consensus is that society would beneﬁt from et al. 2012 ). If people are aware of variations in the such awareness has the potential to create a cleaner environment and a healthier population. Studies and initiatives examining public awareness and understanding in this area have yielded mixed warnings associated with ground level O 3do have a air quality. Bell et al. ( 2004 ) have also hypothesised induced mortality observed across US communities.Other research has concluded that both awareness of understanding of air quality information are lackingamongst the public (Bickerstaff and Walker 2001 ; European Commission (EC) conducted a ﬂash Euro-barometer to gain a greater insight into the views of the disorders, cardiovascular diseases and asthma/allergy were 87, 92 and 87 % respectively. Factors determining awareness Other than the availability of sufﬁcient information governing how aware individuals are about the quality Fig. 4 Biological pathways linking PM exposure withoxidative and inﬂammatory pathways in the lung and cardiovasculature640 Environ Geochem Health (2015) 37:631–649 123 are likely to include understanding, perception and a standing of what is undoubtedly a complex science. Unlike other environmental risks that are routinelycommunicated such as UV and heat, overall air quality encompasses several primary pollutants as well as secondary products owing to atmospheric transforma-tion. Rural areas for example are very often considered times, O concentrations of nitrogen oxides to sequester rural O3. A lack of vested interest in the topic is also possible amongst ‘healthy’ people, less likely to have pollution and/or increasing medication may bring.Indeed, where research has indicated that individuals are aware of air quality warnings and take responsive actions, larger responses were observed for moresusceptible groups or carers thereof (McDermott et al. is another factor inﬂuencing the public understanding data generated by monitoring sites and communicated via an advisory service (Shooter and Brimblecombe2009 ). Several studies have investigated the relation- ship between perceived and measured outdoor air (Atari et al. 2009 ), others have found little or no rather than the advisory service, drove the response.Some epidemiological researchers have also indicated that self-reported health status is associated with et al. 2008 ).Information services Public awareness is fundamentally dependent upon optimal air pollution monitoring, forecasting and reporting. Many countries have air quality monitoringnetworks that are structured around a particular country’s regulatory obligation to report monitored lutants, air quality modelling systems and meteoro- logical data are also processed to create a national airquality index (AQI). Again in line with national legislation, an AQI communicates pollution levels and short term; Table 1). These data are used by the public Another information tool is provided by accessible air tion events via a computer/tablet (websites, email, social media) or phone (texts, apps) (London AirQuality Network; City of London). These are becom- ing increasingly informative and engaging, allowing example, providing low pollution journey planners to reduce exposure (Fig. 5). New developments Whilst monitoring, forecasting and reporting of air quality have become increasingly sophisticated and 123 systems sourced by ﬁxed site monitoring stations are monitors was primarily limited to industries associ- children (Spira-Cohen et al. 2011 ). Now we are witnessing an emerging role for inexpensive, portable, easy-to-use personal monitoring devices (Austen by such sensors is not currently robust enough to compliment data for ofﬁcial monitoring networks, there is undoubtedly a need for more dynamicmeasures of time-activity patterns in relation to low-cost air quality sensors, also has the potential to Added to their ubiquitous technology, the penetrationof these phones is unrivalled in demographics, possibilities in the communication of individual research setting, novel smartphone-based software that records people’s movements and physical activitylevels in the urban environment and is integrated with spatial–temporal maps of air pollution is already being Discussion fore that health effects of PM—one of the pollutantsdeemed most dangerous to health—are well docu- mented. Airborne PM has been the focus of extensive Air At-risk individuals aGeneral population with heart problems, who experience symptoms , should consider reducing strenuous physical activity, particularly outdoorsEnjoy your usual outdoor activities with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors, and particularly if they experience symptoms. People cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors Very heart problems, and older people, should avoid especially if you experience symptoms such as cough or sore throat aAdults and children with heart or lung problems are at greater risk of symptoms642 Environ Geochem Health (2015) 37:631–649 123 the association between short- and long-term exposure to PM and cardiopulmonary mortality and morbidity has become much larger and broader. DEPs are nowclassiﬁed as carcinogenic, and an increasing number of studies are investigating the potential for particulate We now also appreciate that there is no evidence of a studies are showing associations between PM and 2.5. Correspondingly, reductions in population exposure to air pollution appreciable beneﬁts in terms of increased life expectancy and improvements to respiratory health. Having ﬁrmly established associations between ambient PM and adverse health effects, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is inambient PM that affects health—information that in characteristics or sources to be deﬁnitely identiﬁed comparing and synthesising data from existing studies is therefore needed before concluding thatadditional indicators (be they BC or UFPs) have a toxicity by identifying pathways that ultimately link obstructive pulmonary diseases. 123 Evidence has emerged that (a) the burden of ambient PM pollution on health is signiﬁcant at relatively low concentrations, (b) there is no safelower limit and (c) effects follow a mostly linear concentration–response function, suggesting that pub- lic health beneﬁts will result from any reduction inconcentrations. As has been advocated many times before, interventions to reduce levels of particulate ment (environment, transport, energy, health, housing) related particulates means that forward-looking and integrated transport policies are critical for theimprovement of urban environments. Trafﬁc must be investment in clean and affordable public transport vehicles, lowering speed limits and enhancing cycle routes. Another intervention in moving towards a cleaner and healthier environment necessitates behavioural Improving air quality is a considerable but not an undisputedly has the potential to reduce air pollution public health.

The cause of deaths was broken down as follows: ischaemic heart disease (40 %), stroke are based not only on a greater understanding of thediseases caused by poor air quality, but also more accurate exposure assessment that utilises sophisti- cated measurement and modelling technology. Ofnote, the overall mortality estimate more than doubles deaths stem from cardiovascular disease. is found in the low- and middle-income countries of the developing nations of these areas. However, theproblem is very much a global one. Focusing on Europe, air pollution is again the biggest environment countries were estimated at 203,000 and 280,000,respectively (WHO 2014 ). In recent years (2010–2012) the proportion of the urban population 10 and PM 2.5concentrations exceeded that was 21 and EU urban population exposure to PM concentrations above the WHO AQG (WHO 2006 ) is signiﬁcantly peans is reduced, on average, by about 8.6 monthsowing to PM 2.5pollution (WHO 2013b ), whilst traditional health impact assessment methods used in 123 concentrations were reduced to the WHO AQG annual level (Fig. 2). signiﬁcant contribution to mortality. Current (2008)data estimate that if the effect of PM 2.5air pollution is considered by itself, it is responsible for at least UK, with mortality rate estimates from long-term PM London boroughs (PHE 2014 ). Upon comparing commonly acknowledged mortality risks, it has been estimated that a 10 lg/m3reduction in ambient PM 2.5pollution (roughly equivalent to eradicating all anthropogenic particles) would have a larger endpoints has been subject to intense study, resulting 2.5and PM 10, with nega- tive impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health following both short-term and chronic exposures.Furthermore, data strongly suggest that effects have no 2.5background concentration–response function (WHO 2013a ).

Improved air quality and improved health We now also have consistent evidence that a reduction sustained intervention (mainly regulatory actions) is associated with improvements in public health. In theUSA, Pope et al. ( 2009 ) used data from the 51 cities long-term PM 2.5data are available. It was reported that reduction in PM 2.5concentration between 1980 and 2000 was strongly associated with 2.7 year overallincreases in life expectancy that occurred during that period (Fig. 3). Evidence has also been demonstrated 2002—a period when the annual average PM 10 concentration decreased by 5–6 lg/m3. This reduction in particle levels was associated with attenuation in theannual rate of decline of lung function (Downs et al. 2007 ). Using the same cohort, Schindler et al. ( 2009 ) 123 10 was associated with improved respiratory health(reduced incidence of chronic cough, bronchitis,common cold, nocturnal dry cough and conjunctivitis health of the Swiss children occurred following optimal air quality management. Differential toxicity of PM Epidemiological and toxicological research ﬁndings have shown that PM mass (PM 2.5and PM 10) com- challenging areas of environmental health research inthat PM is not a single entity.

InLondon, particulate pollution is predominantly diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) mixed with resuspended many characteristics of PM have the potential toinﬂuence the toxicity of ambient PM.

Black carbon 2013a ), the health effects of BC particles have also initiatives have conﬁrmed that sufﬁcient epidemio- logical evidence exists to link short-term (daily) admissions. Evidence is also conclusive that long- term (annual) BC exposure is associated with all-causeand cardiopulmonary mortality. Although distinct mechanistic effects have not been identiﬁed from toxicological studies, suggesting that BC may not be adirect toxic component of ﬁne PM, it is hypothesised beyond. Furthermore, in that short-term studies showthat health effect associations with BC were more robust than those with PM 2.5or PM 10, although BC particles may not constitute a causal agent, it is theopinion that they may well serve as a better indicator of harmful particulate substances (e.g. organics) from Organic carbonOC is a very complex and heterogenous mixture of As a consequence, it is a huge challenge to identify thepotential toxicity of speciﬁc OC constituents and in fact evidence is currently insufﬁcient to distinguish between the toxicity of primary and secondary organicaerosols. Studies are, however, generating increasing endpoints. Ostro et al. ( 2010 ) has also observed associations between long-term exposure to organic monary mortality. Inorganic secondary aerosols Epidemiological evidence continues to accumulate on the short-term effects of sulphate on cardiovascular 2012 ). Data have also emerged on associations namely ventricular arrhythmias (Anderson et al.

For example, the cations particles) may have an underlying toxic role or else particulate components (Oakes et al. 2012 ). Coarse PM Accumulating epidemiological evidence suggests that short-term exposures to coarse particles (between 2.5 and 10 lm) are associated with effects on adverse cardiovascular health, respiratory endpoints health, 123 variable as to whether such effect estimates are higher term effects of coarse PM are fewer and have reported no or limited evidence that this size fraction has an coarse and ﬁne PM have reported that coarse particles can be as toxic as PM 2.5on a mass basis (Graff et al. 2009 ; Wegesser et al. 2009 ). Data, however, are not Ultraﬁne particlesUFPs (smaller than 0.1 lm) have many unique properties that have led scientists to hypothesise thatthis size fraction may have speciﬁc or enhanced toxicity relative to ﬁne (PM 2.5) or coarse PM.

In addition to trafﬁc density per se, it is not surprising thereforethat the greatest health impacts appear to be associated to humans based on sufﬁcient evidence that it is linked 123 toxicity and health consequences of roadside PM have focused on DEPs, the non-exhaust sources are attract- health effects is largely ignored at the regulatory level Riediker et al. 2004 ). Mechanisms of PM toxicity The well-established evidence that PM pollution contributes to an array of health outcomes has resulted mechanistic pathways. Although there remains much short- and long-term PM 2.5exposure with mortality and morbidity has evolved rapidly and continues to doso. For example, in investigating subclinical physio- logical changes, epidemiological research has ﬁbrinogen—subtle responses that have been consis- to study mechanistic pathways and physiological endpoints related to adverse effects following DEPexposure is the use of controlled exposure studies in environmentally relevant DE exposure experiments, combined with cardiovascular measurements, BAL and bronchial biopsy have revealed well-deﬁnedsystemic, pulmonary and cardiac responses involving a variety of cellular and molecular perturbations. It is probable that associations between the various con-stituents of PM and health effects are the result of nisms. Current evidence does, however, support a tion, translocation of particle constituents and an cardiovascular and obstructive pulmonary diseases (Kelly and Fussell 2015 ; Fig. 4).

( 2004 ) have also hypothesised induced mortality observed across US communities.Other research has concluded that both awareness of understanding of air quality information are lackingamongst the public (Bickerstaff and Walker 2001 ; European Commission (EC) conducted a ﬂash Euro-barometer to gain a greater insight into the views of the disorders, cardiovascular diseases and asthma/allergy were 87, 92 and 87 % respectively. Factors determining awareness Other than the availability of sufﬁcient information governing how aware individuals are about the quality Fig. 4 Biological pathways linking PM exposure withoxidative and inﬂammatory pathways in the lung and cardiovasculature640 Environ Geochem Health (2015) 37:631–649 123 are likely to include understanding, perception and a standing of what is undoubtedly a complex science. Unlike other environmental risks that are routinelycommunicated such as UV and heat, overall air quality encompasses several primary pollutants as well as secondary products owing to atmospheric transforma-tion. Rural areas for example are very often considered times, O concentrations of nitrogen oxides to sequester rural O3. A lack of vested interest in the topic is also possible amongst ‘healthy’ people, less likely to have pollution and/or increasing medication may bring.Indeed, where research has indicated that individuals are aware of air quality warnings and take responsive actions, larger responses were observed for moresusceptible groups or carers thereof (McDermott et al. is another factor inﬂuencing the public understanding data generated by monitoring sites and communicated via an advisory service (Shooter and Brimblecombe2009 ). Several studies have investigated the relation- ship between perceived and measured outdoor air (Atari et al. 2009 ), others have found little or no rather than the advisory service, drove the response.Some epidemiological researchers have also indicated that self-reported health status is associated with et al. 2008 ).Information services Public awareness is fundamentally dependent upon optimal air pollution monitoring, forecasting and reporting. Many countries have air quality monitoringnetworks that are structured around a particular country’s regulatory obligation to report monitored lutants, air quality modelling systems and meteoro- logical data are also processed to create a national airquality index (AQI). Again in line with national legislation, an AQI communicates pollution levels and short term; Table 1). These data are used by the public Another information tool is provided by accessible air tion events via a computer/tablet (websites, email, social media) or phone (texts, apps) (London AirQuality Network; City of London). These are becom- ing increasingly informative and engaging, allowing example, providing low pollution journey planners to reduce exposure (Fig. 5). New developments Whilst monitoring, forecasting and reporting of air quality have become increasingly sophisticated and 123 systems sourced by ﬁxed site monitoring stations are monitors was primarily limited to industries associ- children (Spira-Cohen et al. 2011 ). Now we are witnessing an emerging role for inexpensive, portable, easy-to-use personal monitoring devices (Austen by such sensors is not currently robust enough to compliment data for ofﬁcial monitoring networks, there is undoubtedly a need for more dynamicmeasures of time-activity patterns in relation to low-cost air quality sensors, also has the potential to Added to their ubiquitous technology, the penetrationof these phones is unrivalled in demographics, possibilities in the communication of individual research setting, novel smartphone-based software that records people’s movements and physical activitylevels in the urban environment and is integrated with spatial–temporal maps of air pollution is already being Discussion fore that health effects of PM—one of the pollutantsdeemed most dangerous to health—are well docu- mented.

DEPs are nowclassiﬁed as carcinogenic, and an increasing number of studies are investigating the potential for particulate We now also appreciate that there is no evidence of a studies are showing associations between PM and 2.5. Correspondingly, reductions in population exposure to air pollution appreciable beneﬁts in terms of increased life expectancy and improvements to respiratory health. Having ﬁrmly established associations between ambient PM and adverse health effects, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is inambient PM that affects health—information that in characteristics or sources to be deﬁnitely identiﬁed comparing and synthesising data from existing studies is therefore needed before concluding thatadditional indicators (be they BC or UFPs) have a toxicity by identifying pathways that ultimately link obstructive pulmonary diseases. 123 Evidence has emerged that (a) the burden of ambient PM pollution on health is signiﬁcant at relatively low concentrations, (b) there is no safelower limit and (c) effects follow a mostly linear concentration–response function, suggesting that pub- lic health beneﬁts will result from any reduction inconcentrations. As has been advocated many times before, interventions to reduce levels of particulate ment (environment, transport, energy, health, housing) related particulates means that forward-looking and integrated transport policies are critical for theimprovement of urban environments. Trafﬁc must be investment in clean and affordable public transport vehicles, lowering speed limits and enhancing cycle routes.

Introduction Air pollution in China has been very severe, causing huge health damages and social losses for a long time. In the meantime air pollution control polices have over the last couple of National large-scale polices have been initiated and implemented, such as the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (hereinafter the Action Plan) [ 1]. It is well known that energy (or more precisely coal) is the primary source of air pollution and carbon emissions in China, and the closely related energy and climate polices are also experiencing signiﬁcant changes. are immediately faced with difﬁculties. Research-based information is scattered in several lines of the and the policy-relevant discussions provided are broad, and from a national perspective (e.g., [ 2–4]). individual policies (e.g., [ 9–11]). There are recent Chinese empirical studies (e.g., [ 12–16]) and some some short commentaries (e.g., [17]), more detailed, systematic follow-ups are rarely seen. policies in China are experiencing profound changes. With China’s signiﬁcant role on air pollution, deep and up-to-date understanding of China’s air pollution policies is of great relevance. Moreover, as opportunities to learn from these experiences. The paper is structured as follows: the next two sections ﬁrst describe the air pollution status factors for policy changes and conclude by summarizing trends and challenges for the future. It is Air pollution is closely related to some other key challenges for China, e.g., climate change, energy most of the time period which this review covers, the air pollution control policy process in China has been relatively independent of climate or energy policy process. Recently this has changed and with 2. Air Pollution Status and Evolution In China, the major air pollution problems have been mainly attributable to coal burning and industry processes during the early stage of economic development. Recently vehicle emissions have pollutants (primary pollutants are directly emitted from certain sources; secondary pollutants are concentration has been observed, but a more complex, regional air pollution problem dominated by with different aerodynamic diameters) and ground level ozone (O 3) has emerged. Chinese economic growth has been powered by a coal-dominated surging fossil fuel consumption air pollution in China has been estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) to lead to totally offsetting China’s current annual GDP growth. “smoke and dust” in statistics yearbooks) have passed their peak and are diminishing (Figure 1a), and their concentrations have signiﬁcantly declined [ 19,20] (Figure 2a,c).

It is evident that China therefore faces different challenges than developed 3. Environmental Regulatory System The institutional composition and dynamics of the environmental regulatory system in China is governance foundation for later sections. The environment regulatory system in China is viewed environmental regulations have been weak and questionable during the past decades. As an illustrative summary, Figure 4 (discussed in more detail later) shows the institutional structures and the channels surrounding areas of the cities. On the national level coal burning is still dominant in contributing to site dust, industrial processes, are possibly ignorable [42]. Moreover, regional transmission also plays an important role [43]. In China the air pollution situation is severe, widely distributed, and the atmospheric chemical reactions complex. These characteristics indicate no easy solution and that any effective control strategy has to target all the major pollutants from different sources, and control measures have to be jointly designed and wisely combined. It is eviden t that China therefore faces different challenges a century. 3. Environmental Regulatory System The institutional composition and dynamics of the environmental regulatory system in China is governance foundation for later sections. The enviro nment regulatory system in China is viewed as environmental regulations have been weak and qu estionable during the past decades. As an Figure 4. Environmental governance in China.

Environmental governance in China. from central government (the red area in Figure 4) to jurisdictional-based local governments. secretary, mayor and vice-mayor) are the ones in charge of public affairs within their geographic the local government (orange area in Figure 4). As they are largely promotion driven, their limited attention and the tradeoffs in resource allocation are naturally inﬂuenced by the incentives given by the promotion mechanisms. Promotion of local ofﬁcials in China is a complicated “cadre evaluation” process in the Five-Year-Plan (FYP) framework (see, e.g., [ 8]). The FYPs are a cycle process starting from the release of goals are “administratively subcontracted” [ 44] to local governments. The bureaucratic personnel are be promoted or not. Some key characteristics of this process are: (1) the ones getting higher rankings are more likely to be promoted; (2) the strongest promotion incentive is concentrated on the local main leaders; and (3) though subcontracted tasks are numerous, covering most public areas, only economic development (e.g., GDP) is tracked and veto-track factors largely determine the evaluation ranking. A veto means that if the target is not fulﬁlled, there will deﬁnite be no chance for promotion, one example was birth control targets. Environmental protection is among the highly subcontracted jurisdictional obligations. However, for a long time it was not included in the two emphasized tracks of factors in the promotion assessment. Therefore the difﬁculties in its implementation are largely inherent and only in relatively rare cases compounded by the lack of capacity in EPBs, they hardly have a sufﬁcient ﬁscal budget and personnel for monitoring and enforcement. Weak implementation as the overall result of the constraints is not destined to persist though. When the rules of promotion are changed and the veto track factors begin to include environmental ones, local main leaders have to pay attention. When these factors start being measured in a way that leaders have to really implement the regulations. Further, when strong political pressure from the central government is perceived by local governments, the latter may even “over implement” and “innovatively implement”. 3.2. What Are the Environmental Policies? in Section 3.1. They are: (1) environmental laws, rules and standards; (2) national plans in the FYP and climate policies are also highly relevant to air pollution, but for a long time they were part of 3.2.1. Environmental Laws and Standards China has many environmental laws at different legislative levels. In 1978, the Third Chinese Wang has reviewed environment law in China and summarized them as covering every aspect of environment management, but to have low legislative quality, too many principles, being very basic and difﬁcult to actually enforce [48]. standards in China were established early, even in the 1980s, and then were ﬁxed or even loosened the winter between 2012 and 2013), these standards have been updated and signiﬁcantly strengthened. The current standards are largely in line with international ones and for power plants even more summarized based on standards available at Ministry of Environment (MEP) website [49]. 1992 GB13223-91 -2200–33003- 1996 GB13223-1996 1200–21004200–3300 650–1000 2004 GB13223-2003 400–2100 50–600 450– 11004 2012 GB13223-2011 50–200 20–30 100–200 1984 GB3841-83 - 200–600 - 1992 GB13271-91 1200–1800 100–400 - 2001 GB13271-2001 900–1200 80–350 - 2014 GB13271-2014 200–400 30–80 200–400 2000 GB18352.1-2001S 2.72 - - 0.97 - C 2.72 - - 0.97–1.36 0.14–0.2 2004 GB18352.2-2001S 2.2 - - 0.5 - C 1 - - 0.7–0.9 0.08–0.1 2007 GB18352.3-2005S 2.3 0.2 0.15 - - C 0.64 - 0.5 0.56 0.05 2010 GB18352.3-2005S 1 0.1 0.08 - - C 0.5 - 0.25 0.3 0.025 2017 GB18352.5-2013S 1 0.1 0.06 - 0.0045 C 0.5 - 0.18 0.23 0.0045 Table 1.

National Environmental Plans within the FYPs will have concrete chapters in the nationwide FYP , their goals will be more quantitatively articulated Among the many public area targets, the solid type is “mandatory” targets. They are guaranteed to be attained and implemented in advance [ 51]. These targets are decomposed and allocated to local became more speciﬁc and concrete in later FYPs [ 52]. The 11th FYP (2006–2010) is the milestone in During the past decades, ten speciﬁc conventional regulatory measures have been solidiﬁed. These measures are often referred to as “Old Three, New Five, Target Response and Total Emission Control” (Old Three refers to 1 to 3 of the list, and were solidiﬁed between 1972 and 1979, New Five refers to 4 to 8 and are solidiﬁed between 1980 and 1989. “Lao San Xiang, Xin Wuxiang, Mu Biao Ze Ren Generally when talking about environmental regulatory implementation in China, it is one or several of these measures being used: EIAs before their construction. In 2003 this measure was expanded to including planning EIAs. no longer restricted to excessive discharge. ranking information of about a hundred cities are made public. pollutants and information of discharge pipes are speciﬁed. are jointly planed, designed and operated, as an additional mechanism to the conventional independently performed way. of wastes in production, and conduct cleaner production audits and report to the relevant level are responsible for environmental protection in their jurisdiction and the responsible persons a certain cap are allocated to local governments/targeted enterprises. Early trials were in the 3.2.4. Special Actions outside the FYPs China is able to quickly respond to all kinds of “situations” (e.g., crisis, special needs, and Usually they are local, short-term administrative measures at any costs [ 58]. Sometimes, after a certain situation is subsided, parts of these measures will be adopted at regional or national level and even be integrated in later FYPs [ 6]. Some examples of special actions are the Environmental Law Enforcement Plan as triggered by the PM 2.5crisis. “State ideologies” in China are soft policies in the broad sense. On the surface they look like national planning. In terms of the possibility in deriving some concrete policies they may have very different results. World-known and thoroughly implemented state ideologies are “Focus on Economic Construction” and “Family Planning”. Historic experience shows that a dozen of environment-related The latest one is “Ecological Civilization”) largely accomplished their mission as slogans, but from their has become clearer over time [6]. 3.3. An Illustrative Summary remaining unchanged for 25 years, has been amended in 2014 and some of the new law articles are regarded as unprecedentedly strict [ 60]. Non-governmental actors, not shown in Figure 4, have been granted the legal power to claim environmental rights [61], hence their role is increasing. Based on previous trials focusing on eliminating industrial smoke and dust, the basic system of air pollution control was established in the Law on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric requirements; and (4) if the law is violated, ﬁnes with the maximum capped at 500,000 RMB (exchange rate: 1 USD = 8.28 RMB in 2000) shall be applied. Usually this is at most a small percentage of the reform in the subsequent decades. physical outcomes, the 3S and pollution fees. The reality of implementation of the 3S was puzzling. 3S over total ﬁxed assets kept around 5 ‰. If both were true it would imply that new ﬁxed investment went to less polluting industries, which is not supported by the ofﬁcial statistics [58]: Invest 3s Total invest dirty+Total invest clean =implementation rate o f 3S\u0002b 1+Total investclean Total investdirty=5‰(1) The pollution fee was a small levy on enterprises. Theoretically, its social efﬁcient level equals the marginal damage cost. However, in most industries pollution fee levels were much lower, even the average abatement costs of SO 2in coal ﬁred power plants were between 4 to 6 yuan/kg [ 62]). “Deal enforcement” [ 58] was in some cases the result, far from the original policy intention, with their own daily operations. 4.1.1. Some Fundamental Flaws Looking back on what actually happened before 2005, air pollution, severe though, was not regarded as an urgent social problem. The nature of the management regime was not so much a broad discharge. It did have positive regulatory effects, but to a larger extent became a fetter on subsequent policy adjustments. The limitations are clear: 1. The general principles of environmental rights and interests are absent. It lacks the concept that the atmospheric environmental capacity is natural capital, is scarce and has value. It does not have an ultimate regulatory aim to protect human health and enhance social welfare. 2. Inefﬁciencies are present. Air pollutants transmit and transform but the management is jurisdiction-based, therefore “leakage” and lack of regional coordination are predestined to Pollution fees are too low compared to the efﬁcient level. 3. Monitoring capacity as a basic regulatory element is not created, therefore all policy instruments designed based on the emission situation become ineffective. Estimated data with information 4. Credibility of the law and regulations is seriously challenged. The cost of breaking environmental laws is strikingly low [ 64].Legal liability theoretically exists, but judicial latitude of discretion is huge preserves an expectation that they are and will be tacitly permitted to be incompletely implemented. The Chinese central government is located in Beijing, where the air quality has long been notoriously bad. Unlike that in other places, in Beijing air pollution control was a political task efforts of Beijing were not enough to bring about any signiﬁcant air quality improvement. These efforts were not totally in vain, though, by providing important evidence; vehicle exhausts control, among all the measures, was found to contribute the most to concentration abatement potential of NO xand PM 2.5in Beijing [68]. Based on what happened until 2005 many studies, as summarized in [ 63], predicted that without The policies were the “total emission control on SO 2” and the closely relevant “energy saving” policy. reduction from the 2005 level was set as the national target. On energy saving, the target was a 20% reduction of energy consumption per unit of GDP from the 2005 level. National targets were upper assigned target. In the 12th FYP (2011–2015) these policies were maintained and extended. It should be noted that the national total control policies were initiated in the 9th FYP and further speciﬁed in the 10th FYP but back then the implementation and results were failures (see, e.g., [ 10]). In the 11th FYP , the implementation became remarkable and the targets were achieved. However the air quality improvements were insigniﬁcant. Then three key questions arise: (1) Why did the local industries? (3) Why the efforts are ineffective and inefﬁcient in improving air quality? These three questions are discussed in the following sections. the successful implementation of total control policies was that each province’s target became unprecedentedly “mandatory” and was linked to the veto track factors in cadre evaluation of local main leaders. If the annual target were not met, then the local leaders were ordered to rectify within do something if emission data could still be relatively easily adjusted. That was exactly what happened Field evidence shows that local governments did manipulate emission data [ 63]. The centralization of emission data management was another key element for local governments’ real implementation of data management was established, with the key feature that data is now controlled and veriﬁed by upper level agencies. Local EPBs only do data collection and report to regional supervision centers whose administrative ranks are higher than those of the provincial governments. The regional centers a “cumbersome” process. Field evidence shows that the details of the data examination and veriﬁcation were so sophisticated that the space for fabrication shrank signiﬁcantly. Finally, the annual emission reduction of a province was certiﬁcated by MEP and was used in cadre evaluation (details see, e.g., [ 63]). This centralized data management guaranteed that the assessment of local implementation was based on real efforts. sector emits the most SO 2and the abatement capacity was huge with “low hanging fruits” [ 6]. It was (and still is) composed of big and small units mostly belonging to ﬁve state owned enterprises (SOE) whose leaders are another track of bureaucratic personnel and have similar promotion incentives as local main leaders, therefore negotiations between the two are not that difﬁcult. The big units overall have limited heterogeneity and can be easily added the mature ﬂue gas desulfurization (FGD) For desulfurization in big units, the FGD facilities were quickly installed whereas their normal operation was later gradually realized along with the policy tightening. It was a price type instrument To phase out small power plant units and some other outdated enterprises was a forced process, and the public security bureau to guarantee the enforcement (the enforcement was guaranteed by the police force). In the 12th FYP , the targeted two emissions are SO 2plus NO X. SO 2is to be further abated. For NO X, it is the power plant sector who again takes the leading role of “denitrifying”. 4.2.3. Why the Efforts Are Ineffective and Inefﬁcient in Improving Air Quality? quality. Elementary atmospheric chemistry shows that the transformation from primary pollutants such as SO 2, NO Xand primary PM to secondary pollutants is complicated and is non-linear, as described in earlier sections. Therefore, when a single type of primary pollutant emission is reduced, might change, but not much. moment. SO 2transmits within a regional scope. The jurisdictional based management cannot promote inter-regional cooperation in abatement efforts (see, e.g., [ 7,73]). More developed places have higher demand for SO 2pollution abatement but their more aggressive efforts are partially offset by the transmitted amount from their less developed neighbors. Using SO 2inventory data from 2006 in jurisdictional management. were not exploited. For example, marginal pollutant abatement costs ($/ton) differ signiﬁcantly technologies, marginal abatement costs are considerably different. In other more heterogeneous sectors such as industrial boilers, space for cost saving is even larger. Moreover, the effect from geographical costs ($/ \u0016g\u0001m\u00003) in these territories are also different. The administrative allocation of reduction jointly reduce the abatement costs. To improve Beijing’s air quality for the 2008 Olympic Games was a solemn promise and was measures mentioned previously strictly implemented, more radical measures were gradually adopted after 2005 (see, e.g., [ 75]). Regional transported pollution was taken into account and during the Olympics multiple measures were implemented in surrounding territories including Tianjin, Hebei, dust and banning of straw burning [ 66]. To implement them everywhere was unrealistic, instead cost-effectiveness considerations. The Beijing Olympics air quality management, as the very ﬁrst one based on regional mechanism in China, was remarkably effective. Air quality in Beijing improved signiﬁcantly during and after the were attributable to plant closures and trafﬁc control (see, e.g., [ 75]) and such measures have also been The haze with its unprecedentedly high index of PM 2.5concentration and extremely low visibility was Beijing and Beijing EPB’s descriptive air pollution index were noticed and questioned [ 77], the health into a social crisis [78]. 2013 that China is not willing to and shall not “pollute ﬁrst and clean up later”, instead shall treat pollution with “iron ﬁsts” [ 79]. Subsequently the “iron ﬁsts” was unexceptionally used in ofﬁcial media and local government documents. The strong political will was further solidiﬁed in the 2014 government work report, “China shall punch hard to strengthen the prevention and control of pollution, and resolutely declare war against pollution” [80]. 20% and 15% Ten Tasks 7. Improve law and regulation system. Carry on supervision and management based on law English version is available at http://sustainabletransport.org/china-releases-national-action-plan-on-air- pollution-control/. management (Table 2). From this Action Plan various policies have emerged. Here we classify have been fully implemented, such as desulfurization, denitriﬁcation and dust precipitation of capacity. As vehicles are important contributors to NO x, the early retirement of old vehicles is also emphasized. The 12th FYP is coming to an end and its total emission control goals for major pollutants have already being achieved in advance or are about to be reached. plans have similar structure compared to the nation one, including ﬁrstly the provincial air quality improvement goals and then a list of measures. These goals are not explicitly linked to the highest weight given to air quality goals. Serious accountability is reﬂected by some recent in this grading system [81]. analysis: A common feature of these efforts is that uniﬁcation within regional scope is emphasized. Many standards are being updated, including air quality and heave pollution alerting index networks are being built. Key regions and major cities are required to establish their source Among the cities that have ﬁnished the analysis, results are similar with different shares among the main sources in different sectors [82]. 4. Regional cooperation mechanism is taking substantial steps: Based on previous experiences, in fuel quality and vehicle exhausts [83]. Equivalent (Mtce) by 2020 was chosen as a core strategy to address the ambient air pollution in China. The BTH, YRD and PRD regions are required to cap coal consumption by 2017. Similar to total emission control, annual coal reduction goals are subcontracted to provincial and municipal governments. “Coal to gas” in power plants was ﬁrst implemented in Beijing and quickly adopted by other places. However, currently (besides Beijing) most of them have suspended or canceled the initiative, mainly because natural gas is still scarce and costly in China. Evidence show that “coal to gas” in power plants in Beijing is likely to be a net social economic loss in the “ultra-low-emission technology” are initiated but without shared conclusion of their efﬁciency. industrial boilers, as being implemented in some places, is also challenged [84]. subject to criminal penalties are made explicit [ 85]. In 2014 more than 8000 suspects were arrested in more than 2000 environmental criminal actions, an amount which is twice the number of cases in all the previous 10 years [ 86]. The Environment Protection Law was amended in 2014. From the legal liability perspective, ﬁnes on illegal discharge are now imposed consecutively on found applicable to several new penalty measures have been doubling and tripling on a monthly base [ 81]. Other speciﬁc laws on air, water and soil are under revision but the process is not as 7. Public participation and civil society’s role is increasing: Litigation qualification for non-governmental actors is deﬁned in the new law. Around 300 environmental “social organizations” are qualiﬁed as records of enterprises’ penalties. In some provinces, the EPBs are reported as mobilizing in 8. Price and quantity type market instruments are being simultaneously designed in full swing: For pollutants, pollution fees are to be changed into pollution taxes as reflected in the Environmental permits are implemented in pilot provinces and cities. Primary markets are established, whereas transactions of permits in secondary markets are not frequent [ 87]. Carbon taxes and tradable permits, though not directly targeting air pollution, obviously are relevant. There are Commission (NDRC) has been leading the preparation of tradable carbon permits. The Ministry of Finance has been involved in designing a carbon tax. Theoretical research does not provide realize ﬁrst best abatement levels when the two types coexist. Rather it is a case by case situation empirical research is needed in the current Chinese context. Knowledge beyond economics is also important. For example, the current local tax collecting system in China may be used for 5. Discussion Until now we have seen three major changes of air pollution control policies with signiﬁcant suggest that China is undergoing fundamental reform on her own initiative. Rather they, as good the repeated and circle governance phenomena from history to present in China has made important and recentralization of power, which is one theme of dynamics in the principal-agent relationship which should have been seen as a public good provision, was decentralized and administrative subcontracted together with other economic development tasks. Implementation was bound to fail the system largely unchanged, the power to manage and verify the data was partially recentralized to the principal central government by the new data management system and then implementation was guaranteed, though full of distortions and inefﬁciencies. The effective while short-lived regional air quality management during the mega events is or pros and cons, it is an important supplement to China’s regular governance system [ 57]. When there is a special situation of need, campaign style regulations can be very effective by quickly mobilizing attention and resource are gathered to fulﬁll certain short-term goals. The temporary changes in air quality management in mega events are such a process. neighbors [ 90]. However, after two years since the crisis, all kinds of new policies are still emerging and air quality management is likely to experience major changes. From what have happened it of “informal” governance has been shrinking and the governance is adapting itself to the changes in way such as to declare that “all is well” or perform “informal” measures. Governance is pushed 5.2. Macro Trends That Have Taken Shape Changes in air quality management in China are the “tip of the iceberg” of an ongoing profound patterns. Based on what is going on, some macro level trends are taking shape: is that it has become one of the top priorities in all the efforts belonging to the construction of is an “extremely important and urgent mission” as recently reconﬁrmed by the central power. A red line on environmental quality is also set by the central leadership, that air, water and soil form the foundation of the ongoing changes. 2. Public participation and the civil society’s role are increasing: “Environment in China has severely deteriorated” has already become an irreversible public consensus. Along with the income increase right-defending actions, after a dozen of years of small scale but unremitting pursuit, have obtained breakthroughs recently. Environmental litigation qualiﬁcation for non-governmental actors is rights. Governments’ attitude also changes. Local EPBs are becoming willing to disclose more such as monitoring, atmospheric modeling, source apportionment, health risk assessments have were not utilized outside academia, except during the several mega events. Now there is an damage liabilities, etc., become possible. This is to some extent the infrastructure for most of future policy designs. development: Air pollution control is used as the breakthrough point of environmental protection reform, which in turn is used by the central power as a leading factor to reshape the economy and such as cap on coal are being taken to ensure the achievement of the quantitative climate promises. 6. Conclusions important topic. implementation. A typical example is the big controversy surrounding the revision of the Law on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution (the revision was ﬁnished on the 29 August 2015, and the new law comes into force from 2016). This revision is originally aimed as an effort to solidify Based on the experiences of the total control policies, people learned that implementation and and the centralized data management system. The legislation committee has the intention to solidify propose the elimination of the total control measures. Total control is just one abatement measure and is not a quality based design. The 11th FYP experience has proved that insuring the implementation of Most of the shared experts’ ideas are summarized in [ 94]. First and foremost, an ultimate subject should penetrate throughout the law rather than only being mentioned in the beginning, which is evaluation and liability should center on the quality based themes and goals. Some recent important based information and the possibility to make environmental civil rights claim based on this quality information. Experts’ ideas are not novel compared to international practice and are to some extent self-evident from the basic environmental economics and law perspective. The reason why it is still is that the latter means to abandon, or at least major reform, the existing total control data accounting MEP and local governments are already familiar with. Though it may not be realized in the near future, we have good reason to predict a revolutionary social welfare by protecting human health through improving air quality. Therefore, air quality based and health risk based management scheme is the general direction. For now, as always, the ﬁnal format of the revised law might not be fundamentally critical since environmental governance in China is and Acknowledgments: This research is supported by the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Pollution Control.

However, surface ozone (O 3) has become an increasing future attention.

This signi ﬁcant change is also attributed to the erator units. The overall temporal NO xpattern is similar to the SO 2pattern, National PM standards have changed greatly over the past four de- cades.

In general, AOT40 values in 2017 were higher than those in 2016, indicating that the effect of O 3on forests in China is becoming more serious. The reported increase in O 3pollution was more signi ﬁcant in some economic centers, including the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (North (Wang et al., 2016, 2017 ;Gong et al., 2018 ). In 2017, the average valueof AOT40 in 363 cities nationwide was 35,016 ppb h ( Fig. 6 ). By region, AOT40 of the North China Plain is 50,350 ppb h, which was higher than AOT40f.

Introduction Air pollution in China has been very severe, causing huge health damages and social losses for a long time. In the meantime air pollution control polices have over the last couple of National large-scale polices have been initiated and implemented, such as the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (hereinafter the Action Plan) [ 1]. It is well known that energy (or more precisely coal) is the primary source of air pollution and carbon emissions in China, and the closely related energy and climate polices are also experiencing signiﬁcant changes. are immediately faced with difﬁculties. Research-based information is scattered in several lines of the and the policy-relevant discussions provided are broad, and from a national perspective (e.g., [ 2–4]). individual policies (e.g., [ 9–11]). There are recent Chinese empirical studies (e.g., [ 12–16]) and some some short commentaries (e.g., [17]), more detailed, systematic follow-ups are rarely seen. policies in China are experiencing profound changes. With China’s signiﬁcant role on air pollution, deep and up-to-date understanding of China’s air pollution policies is of great relevance. Moreover, as opportunities to learn from these experiences. The paper is structured as follows: the next two sections ﬁrst describe the air pollution status factors for policy changes and conclude by summarizing trends and challenges for the future. It is Air pollution is closely related to some other key challenges for China, e.g., climate change, energy most of the time period which this review covers, the air pollution control policy process in China has been relatively independent of climate or energy policy process. Recently this has changed and with 2. Air Pollution Status and Evolution In China, the major air pollution problems have been mainly attributable to coal burning and industry processes during the early stage of economic development. Recently vehicle emissions have pollutants (primary pollutants are directly emitted from certain sources; secondary pollutants are concentration has been observed, but a more complex, regional air pollution problem dominated by with different aerodynamic diameters) and ground level ozone (O 3) has emerged. Chinese economic growth has been powered by a coal-dominated surging fossil fuel consumption air pollution in China has been estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) to lead to totally offsetting China’s current annual GDP growth. “smoke and dust” in statistics yearbooks) have passed their peak and are diminishing (Figure 1a), and their concentrations have signiﬁcantly declined [ 19,20] (Figure 2a,c). Meanwhile, the less regulated per unit of GDP have declined (Figure 1b). emission intensity data is calculat ed based on the 1990 price in CNY. 1996–2014 [26–32] . For PM 2.5 and O 3 concentration, the situation is worsening [33].

Coal smoke mainly contains SO 2, (for example, vehicles were found to contribute to about 30%–56% of total Pearl River Delta regional NO x and Non-Methane VOC emissions [39,40] ) which were added to the previous problems [38].

On the national level coal burning is still dominant in contributing to the primary processes, are possibly ignorable [ 42]. Moreover, regional transmission also plays an important role [ 43]. In China the air pollution situation is severe, widely distributed, and the atmospheric chemical has to target all the major pollutants from different sources, and control measures have to be jointly designed and wisely combined. It is evident that China therefore faces different challenges than developed 3. Environmental Regulatory System The institutional composition and dynamics of the environmental regulatory system in China is governance foundation for later sections. The environment regulatory system in China is viewed environmental regulations have been weak and questionable during the past decades. As an illustrative summary, Figure 4 (discussed in more detail later) shows the institutional structures and the channels surrounding areas of the cities. On the national level coal burning is still dominant in contributing to site dust, industrial processes, are possibly ignorable [42]. Moreover, regional transmission also plays an important role [43]. In China the air pollution situation is severe, widely distributed, and the atmospheric chemical reactions complex. These characteristics indicate no easy solution and that any effective control strategy has to target all the major pollutants from different sources, and control measures have to be jointly designed and wisely combined. It is eviden t that China therefore faces different challenges a century. 3. Environmental Regulatory System The institutional composition and dynamics of the environmental regulatory system in China is governance foundation for later sections. The enviro nment regulatory system in China is viewed as environmental regulations have been weak and qu estionable during the past decades. As an Figure 4. Environmental governance in China.

Environmental governance in China. from central government (the red area in Figure 4) to jurisdictional-based local governments. secretary, mayor and vice-mayor) are the ones in charge of public affairs within their geographic the local government (orange area in Figure 4). As they are largely promotion driven, their limited attention and the tradeoffs in resource allocation are naturally inﬂuenced by the incentives given by the promotion mechanisms. Promotion of local ofﬁcials in China is a complicated “cadre evaluation” process in the Five-Year-Plan (FYP) framework (see, e.g., [ 8]). The FYPs are a cycle process starting from the release of goals are “administratively subcontracted” [ 44] to local governments. The bureaucratic personnel are be promoted or not. Some key characteristics of this process are: (1) the ones getting higher rankings are more likely to be promoted; (2) the strongest promotion incentive is concentrated on the local main leaders; and (3) though subcontracted tasks are numerous, covering most public areas, only economic development (e.g., GDP) is tracked and veto-track factors largely determine the evaluation ranking. A veto means that if the target is not fulﬁlled, there will deﬁnite be no chance for promotion, one example was birth control targets. Environmental protection is among the highly subcontracted jurisdictional obligations. However, for a long time it was not included in the two emphasized tracks of factors in the promotion assessment. Therefore the difﬁculties in its implementation are largely inherent and only in relatively rare cases compounded by the lack of capacity in EPBs, they hardly have a sufﬁcient ﬁscal budget and personnel for monitoring and enforcement. Weak implementation as the overall result of the constraints is not destined to persist though. When the rules of promotion are changed and the veto track factors begin to include environmental ones, local main leaders have to pay attention. When these factors start being measured in a way that leaders have to really implement the regulations. Further, when strong political pressure from the central government is perceived by local governments, the latter may even “over implement” and “innovatively implement”. 3.2. What Are the Environmental Policies? in Section 3.1. They are: (1) environmental laws, rules and standards; (2) national plans in the FYP and climate policies are also highly relevant to air pollution, but for a long time they were part of 3.2.1. Environmental Laws and Standards China has many environmental laws at different legislative levels. In 1978, the Third Chinese Wang has reviewed environment law in China and summarized them as covering every aspect of environment management, but to have low legislative quality, too many principles, being very basic and difﬁcult to actually enforce [48]. standards in China were established early, even in the 1980s, and then were ﬁxed or even loosened the winter between 2012 and 2013), these standards have been updated and signiﬁcantly strengthened. The current standards are largely in line with international ones and for power plants even more summarized based on standards available at Ministry of Environment (MEP) website [49]. 1992 GB13223-91 -2200–33003- 1996 GB13223-1996 1200–21004200–3300 650–1000 2004 GB13223-2003 400–2100 50–600 450– 11004 2012 GB13223-2011 50–200 20–30 100–200 1984 GB3841-83 - 200–600 - 1992 GB13271-91 1200–1800 100–400 - 2001 GB13271-2001 900–1200 80–350 - 2014 GB13271-2014 200–400 30–80 200–400 2000 GB18352.1-2001S 2.72 - - 0.97 - C 2.72 - - 0.97–1.36 0.14–0.2 2004 GB18352.2-2001S 2.2 - - 0.5 - C 1 - - 0.7–0.9 0.08–0.1 2007 GB18352.3-2005S 2.3 0.2 0.15 - - C 0.64 - 0.5 0.56 0.05 2010 GB18352.3-2005S 1 0.1 0.08 - - C 0.5 - 0.25 0.3 0.025 2017 GB18352.5-2013S 1 0.1 0.06 - 0.0045 C 0.5 - 0.18 0.23 0.0045 Table 1.

National Environmental Plans within the FYPs will have concrete chapters in the nationwide FYP , their goals will be more quantitatively articulated Among the many public area targets, the solid type is “mandatory” targets. They are guaranteed to be attained and implemented in advance [ 51]. These targets are decomposed and allocated to local became more speciﬁc and concrete in later FYPs [ 52]. The 11th FYP (2006–2010) is the milestone in During the past decades, ten speciﬁc conventional regulatory measures have been solidiﬁed. These measures are often referred to as “Old Three, New Five, Target Response and Total Emission Control” (Old Three refers to 1 to 3 of the list, and were solidiﬁed between 1972 and 1979, New Five refers to 4 to 8 and are solidiﬁed between 1980 and 1989. “Lao San Xiang, Xin Wuxiang, Mu Biao Ze Ren Generally when talking about environmental regulatory implementation in China, it is one or several of these measures being used: EIAs before their construction. In 2003 this measure was expanded to including planning EIAs. no longer restricted to excessive discharge. ranking information of about a hundred cities are made public. pollutants and information of discharge pipes are speciﬁed. are jointly planed, designed and operated, as an additional mechanism to the conventional independently performed way. of wastes in production, and conduct cleaner production audits and report to the relevant level are responsible for environmental protection in their jurisdiction and the responsible persons a certain cap are allocated to local governments/targeted enterprises. Early trials were in the 3.2.4. Special Actions outside the FYPs China is able to quickly respond to all kinds of “situations” (e.g., crisis, special needs, and Usually they are local, short-term administrative measures at any costs [ 58]. Sometimes, after a certain situation is subsided, parts of these measures will be adopted at regional or national level and even be integrated in later FYPs [ 6]. Some examples of special actions are the Environmental Law Enforcement Plan as triggered by the PM 2.5crisis. “State ideologies” in China are soft policies in the broad sense. On the surface they look like national planning. In terms of the possibility in deriving some concrete policies they may have very different results. World-known and thoroughly implemented state ideologies are “Focus on Economic Construction” and “Family Planning”. Historic experience shows that a dozen of environment-related The latest one is “Ecological Civilization”) largely accomplished their mission as slogans, but from their has become clearer over time [6]. 3.3. An Illustrative Summary remaining unchanged for 25 years, has been amended in 2014 and some of the new law articles are regarded as unprecedentedly strict [ 60]. Non-governmental actors, not shown in Figure 4, have been granted the legal power to claim environmental rights [61], hence their role is increasing. Based on previous trials focusing on eliminating industrial smoke and dust, the basic system of air pollution control was established in the Law on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric requirements; and (4) if the law is violated, ﬁnes with the maximum capped at 500,000 RMB (exchange rate: 1 USD = 8.28 RMB in 2000) shall be applied. Usually this is at most a small percentage of the reform in the subsequent decades. physical outcomes, the 3S and pollution fees. The reality of implementation of the 3S was puzzling. 3S over total ﬁxed assets kept around 5 ‰. If both were true it would imply that new ﬁxed investment went to less polluting industries, which is not supported by the ofﬁcial statistics [58]: Invest 3s Total invest dirty+Total invest clean =implementation rate o f 3S\u0002b 1+Total investclean Total investdirty=5‰(1) The pollution fee was a small levy on enterprises. Theoretically, its social efﬁcient level equals the marginal damage cost. However, in most industries pollution fee levels were much lower, even the average abatement costs of SO 2in coal ﬁred power plants were between 4 to 6 yuan/kg [ 62]). “Deal enforcement” [ 58] was in some cases the result, far from the original policy intention, with their own daily operations. 4.1.1. Some Fundamental Flaws Looking back on what actually happened before 2005, air pollution, severe though, was not regarded as an urgent social problem. The nature of the management regime was not so much a broad discharge. It did have positive regulatory effects, but to a larger extent became a fetter on subsequent policy adjustments. The limitations are clear: 1. The general principles of environmental rights and interests are absent. It lacks the concept that the atmospheric environmental capacity is natural capital, is scarce and has value. It does not have an ultimate regulatory aim to protect human health and enhance social welfare. 2. Inefﬁciencies are present. Air pollutants transmit and transform but the management is jurisdiction-based, therefore “leakage” and lack of regional coordination are predestined to Pollution fees are too low compared to the efﬁcient level. 3. Monitoring capacity as a basic regulatory element is not created, therefore all policy instruments designed based on the emission situation become ineffective. Estimated data with information 4. Credibility of the law and regulations is seriously challenged. The cost of breaking environmental laws is strikingly low [ 64].Legal liability theoretically exists, but judicial latitude of discretion is huge preserves an expectation that they are and will be tacitly permitted to be incompletely implemented. The Chinese central government is located in Beijing, where the air quality has long been notoriously bad. Unlike that in other places, in Beijing air pollution control was a political task efforts of Beijing were not enough to bring about any signiﬁcant air quality improvement. These efforts were not totally in vain, though, by providing important evidence; vehicle exhausts control, among all the measures, was found to contribute the most to concentration abatement potential of NO xand PM 2.5in Beijing [68]. Based on what happened until 2005 many studies, as summarized in [ 63], predicted that without The policies were the “total emission control on SO 2” and the closely relevant “energy saving” policy. reduction from the 2005 level was set as the national target. On energy saving, the target was a 20% reduction of energy consumption per unit of GDP from the 2005 level. National targets were upper assigned target. In the 12th FYP (2011–2015) these policies were maintained and extended. It should be noted that the national total control policies were initiated in the 9th FYP and further speciﬁed in the 10th FYP but back then the implementation and results were failures (see, e.g., [ 10]). In the 11th FYP , the implementation became remarkable and the targets were achieved. However the air quality improvements were insigniﬁcant. Then three key questions arise: (1) Why did the local industries? (3) Why the efforts are ineffective and inefﬁcient in improving air quality? These three questions are discussed in the following sections. the successful implementation of total control policies was that each province’s target became unprecedentedly “mandatory” and was linked to the veto track factors in cadre evaluation of local main leaders. If the annual target were not met, then the local leaders were ordered to rectify within do something if emission data could still be relatively easily adjusted. That was exactly what happened Field evidence shows that local governments did manipulate emission data [ 63]. The centralization of emission data management was another key element for local governments’ real implementation of data management was established, with the key feature that data is now controlled and veriﬁed by upper level agencies. Local EPBs only do data collection and report to regional supervision centers whose administrative ranks are higher than those of the provincial governments. The regional centers a “cumbersome” process. Field evidence shows that the details of the data examination and veriﬁcation were so sophisticated that the space for fabrication shrank signiﬁcantly. Finally, the annual emission reduction of a province was certiﬁcated by MEP and was used in cadre evaluation (details see, e.g., [ 63]). This centralized data management guaranteed that the assessment of local implementation was based on real efforts. sector emits the most SO 2and the abatement capacity was huge with “low hanging fruits” [ 6]. It was (and still is) composed of big and small units mostly belonging to ﬁve state owned enterprises (SOE) whose leaders are another track of bureaucratic personnel and have similar promotion incentives as local main leaders, therefore negotiations between the two are not that difﬁcult. The big units overall have limited heterogeneity and can be easily added the mature ﬂue gas desulfurization (FGD) For desulfurization in big units, the FGD facilities were quickly installed whereas their normal operation was later gradually realized along with the policy tightening. It was a price type instrument To phase out small power plant units and some other outdated enterprises was a forced process, and the public security bureau to guarantee the enforcement (the enforcement was guaranteed by the police force). In the 12th FYP , the targeted two emissions are SO 2plus NO X. SO 2is to be further abated. For NO X, it is the power plant sector who again takes the leading role of “denitrifying”. 4.2.3. Why the Efforts Are Ineffective and Inefﬁcient in Improving Air Quality? quality. Elementary atmospheric chemistry shows that the transformation from primary pollutants such as SO 2, NO Xand primary PM to secondary pollutants is complicated and is non-linear, as described in earlier sections. Therefore, when a single type of primary pollutant emission is reduced, might change, but not much. moment. SO 2transmits within a regional scope. The jurisdictional based management cannot promote inter-regional cooperation in abatement efforts (see, e.g., [ 7,73]). More developed places have higher demand for SO 2pollution abatement but their more aggressive efforts are partially offset by the transmitted amount from their less developed neighbors. Using SO 2inventory data from 2006 in jurisdictional management. were not exploited. For example, marginal pollutant abatement costs ($/ton) differ signiﬁcantly technologies, marginal abatement costs are considerably different. In other more heterogeneous sectors such as industrial boilers, space for cost saving is even larger. Moreover, the effect from geographical costs ($/ \u0016g\u0001m\u00003) in these territories are also different. The administrative allocation of reduction jointly reduce the abatement costs. To improve Beijing’s air quality for the 2008 Olympic Games was a solemn promise and was measures mentioned previously strictly implemented, more radical measures were gradually adopted after 2005 (see, e.g., [ 75]). Regional transported pollution was taken into account and during the Olympics multiple measures were implemented in surrounding territories including Tianjin, Hebei, dust and banning of straw burning [ 66]. To implement them everywhere was unrealistic, instead cost-effectiveness considerations. The Beijing Olympics air quality management, as the very ﬁrst one based on regional mechanism in China, was remarkably effective. Air quality in Beijing improved signiﬁcantly during and after the were attributable to plant closures and trafﬁc control (see, e.g., [ 75]) and such measures have also been The haze with its unprecedentedly high index of PM 2.5concentration and extremely low visibility was Beijing and Beijing EPB’s descriptive air pollution index were noticed and questioned [ 77], the health into a social crisis [78]. 2013 that China is not willing to and shall not “pollute ﬁrst and clean up later”, instead shall treat pollution with “iron ﬁsts” [ 79]. Subsequently the “iron ﬁsts” was unexceptionally used in ofﬁcial media and local government documents. The strong political will was further solidiﬁed in the 2014 government work report, “China shall punch hard to strengthen the prevention and control of pollution, and resolutely declare war against pollution” [80]. 20% and 15% Ten Tasks 7. Improve law and regulation system. Carry on supervision and management based on law English version is available at http://sustainabletransport.org/china-releases-national-action-plan-on-air- pollution-control/. management (Table 2). From this Action Plan various policies have emerged. Here we classify have been fully implemented, such as desulfurization, denitriﬁcation and dust precipitation of capacity. As vehicles are important contributors to NO x, the early retirement of old vehicles is also emphasized. The 12th FYP is coming to an end and its total emission control goals for major pollutants have already being achieved in advance or are about to be reached. plans have similar structure compared to the nation one, including ﬁrstly the provincial air quality improvement goals and then a list of measures. These goals are not explicitly linked to the highest weight given to air quality goals. Serious accountability is reﬂected by some recent in this grading system [81]. analysis: A common feature of these efforts is that uniﬁcation within regional scope is emphasized. Many standards are being updated, including air quality and heave pollution alerting index networks are being built. Key regions and major cities are required to establish their source Among the cities that have ﬁnished the analysis, results are similar with different shares among the main sources in different sectors [82]. 4. Regional cooperation mechanism is taking substantial steps: Based on previous experiences, in fuel quality and vehicle exhausts [83]. Equivalent (Mtce) by 2020 was chosen as a core strategy to address the ambient air pollution in China. The BTH, YRD and PRD regions are required to cap coal consumption by 2017. Similar to total emission control, annual coal reduction goals are subcontracted to provincial and municipal governments. “Coal to gas” in power plants was ﬁrst implemented in Beijing and quickly adopted by other places. However, currently (besides Beijing) most of them have suspended or canceled the initiative, mainly because natural gas is still scarce and costly in China. Evidence show that “coal to gas” in power plants in Beijing is likely to be a net social economic loss in the “ultra-low-emission technology” are initiated but without shared conclusion of their efﬁciency. industrial boilers, as being implemented in some places, is also challenged [84]. subject to criminal penalties are made explicit [ 85]. In 2014 more than 8000 suspects were arrested in more than 2000 environmental criminal actions, an amount which is twice the number of cases in all the previous 10 years [ 86]. The Environment Protection Law was amended in 2014. From the legal liability perspective, ﬁnes on illegal discharge are now imposed consecutively on found applicable to several new penalty measures have been doubling and tripling on a monthly base [ 81]. Other speciﬁc laws on air, water and soil are under revision but the process is not as 7. Public participation and civil society’s role is increasing: Litigation qualification for non-governmental actors is deﬁned in the new law. Around 300 environmental “social organizations” are qualiﬁed as records of enterprises’ penalties. In some provinces, the EPBs are reported as mobilizing in 8. Price and quantity type market instruments are being simultaneously designed in full swing: For pollutants, pollution fees are to be changed into pollution taxes as reflected in the Environmental permits are implemented in pilot provinces and cities. Primary markets are established, whereas transactions of permits in secondary markets are not frequent [ 87]. Carbon taxes and tradable permits, though not directly targeting air pollution, obviously are relevant. There are Commission (NDRC) has been leading the preparation of tradable carbon permits. The Ministry of Finance has been involved in designing a carbon tax. Theoretical research does not provide realize ﬁrst best abatement levels when the two types coexist. Rather it is a case by case situation empirical research is needed in the current Chinese context. Knowledge beyond economics is also important. For example, the current local tax collecting system in China may be used for 5. Discussion Until now we have seen three major changes of air pollution control policies with signiﬁcant suggest that China is undergoing fundamental reform on her own initiative. Rather they, as good the repeated and circle governance phenomena from history to present in China has made important and recentralization of power, which is one theme of dynamics in the principal-agent relationship which should have been seen as a public good provision, was decentralized and administrative subcontracted together with other economic development tasks. Implementation was bound to fail the system largely unchanged, the power to manage and verify the data was partially recentralized to the principal central government by the new data management system and then implementation was guaranteed, though full of distortions and inefﬁciencies. The effective while short-lived regional air quality management during the mega events is or pros and cons, it is an important supplement to China’s regular governance system [ 57]. When there is a special situation of need, campaign style regulations can be very effective by quickly mobilizing attention and resource are gathered to fulﬁll certain short-term goals. The temporary changes in air quality management in mega events are such a process. neighbors [ 90]. However, after two years since the crisis, all kinds of new policies are still emerging and air quality management is likely to experience major changes. From what have happened it of “informal” governance has been shrinking and the governance is adapting itself to the changes in way such as to declare that “all is well” or perform “informal” measures. Governance is pushed 5.2. Macro Trends That Have Taken Shape Changes in air quality management in China are the “tip of the iceberg” of an ongoing profound patterns. Based on what is going on, some macro level trends are taking shape: is that it has become one of the top priorities in all the efforts belonging to the construction of is an “extremely important and urgent mission” as recently reconﬁrmed by the central power. A red line on environmental quality is also set by the central leadership, that air, water and soil form the foundation of the ongoing changes. 2. Public participation and the civil society’s role are increasing: “Environment in China has severely deteriorated” has already become an irreversible public consensus. Along with the income increase right-defending actions, after a dozen of years of small scale but unremitting pursuit, have obtained breakthroughs recently. Environmental litigation qualiﬁcation for non-governmental actors is rights. Governments’ attitude also changes. Local EPBs are becoming willing to disclose more such as monitoring, atmospheric modeling, source apportionment, health risk assessments have were not utilized outside academia, except during the several mega events. Now there is an damage liabilities, etc., become possible. This is to some extent the infrastructure for most of future policy designs. development: Air pollution control is used as the breakthrough point of environmental protection reform, which in turn is used by the central power as a leading factor to reshape the economy and such as cap on coal are being taken to ensure the achievement of the quantitative climate promises. 6. Conclusions important topic. implementation. A typical example is the big controversy surrounding the revision of the Law on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution (the revision was ﬁnished on the 29 August 2015, and the new law comes into force from 2016). This revision is originally aimed as an effort to solidify Based on the experiences of the total control policies, people learned that implementation and and the centralized data management system. The legislation committee has the intention to solidify propose the elimination of the total control measures. Total control is just one abatement measure and is not a quality based design. The 11th FYP experience has proved that insuring the implementation of Most of the shared experts’ ideas are summarized in [ 94]. First and foremost, an ultimate subject should penetrate throughout the law rather than only being mentioned in the beginning, which is evaluation and liability should center on the quality based themes and goals. Some recent important based information and the possibility to make environmental civil rights claim based on this quality information. Experts’ ideas are not novel compared to international practice and are to some extent self-evident from the basic environmental economics and law perspective. The reason why it is still is that the latter means to abandon, or at least major reform, the existing total control data accounting MEP and local governments are already familiar with. Though it may not be realized in the near future, we have good reason to predict a revolutionary social welfare by protecting human health through improving air quality. Therefore, air quality based and health risk based management scheme is the general direction. For now, as always, the ﬁnal format of the revised law might not be fundamentally critical since environmental governance in China is and Acknowledgments: This research is supported by the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Pollution Control.

In conducting the review, speciﬁc objectives were portance for air quality policy. The original concept of this review was borne at the International Conference outdoor sources. There is a growing need to have integrated air pollution and related observations from both ground-based and remote sensing instruments, including in particular those on satellites. The research should also capitalize on the growing area of low-cost sensors, while ensuring a quality of the measurements which are are signiﬁcant feedbacks, such as those related to aerosols, chemistry, and meteorology.

This has been estimated to al., 2018). Nitrogen oxide emissions from ships are regulated NOxreduction. The introduction of the automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS), long-range identiﬁcation and tracking (LRIT), and vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) have enabled tracking of individual ships in unprecedented detail. These navigational local and global scales. Currently, ship emission models using AIS data as an ac- tivity source are most popular. They can have accurate infor- models. Ship emission data are available on a global grid new routes in the Arctic. and departure following the same AIS-based approach as for at berth are estimated based on ship type and size, but with to comply with at least three options. The ﬁrst of these is fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment systems, which are commonly used (estuaries, ports) or water exchange is slow (e.g. the Baltic Sea) (Teuchies et al., 2020).

Methane, methanol, and ammonia are three fuels which three fuels are also suitable for use in internal combustion engines as well as fuel cells.

It is therefore possible to analyse the exposure for the whole lifetime of a person, by using a lifetime trajectory the past life of a person.

A similar approach for estimating the “integrated population-weighted exposure” of the Chinese population to PM 2:5has been used by Aunan et al. (2018) and Zhao et biomass and coal burning.

In addition, the health impacts of PM are related to the isms. Commonly, it is challenging to decipher such effects in terms of each other. The factors may also have either syner- impacts of various PM properties are also known to be phys- In summary, there are many associations of various PM of these inter-dependencies are known relatively better, either qualitatively or quantitatively, while there are also numerous associations, which are currently known poorly. (iii) Research recommendations for deciphering the impacts of various particulate matter properties which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. et al. (2018) reported that there is a severe lack of epidemi- ological studies investigating the health impacts originating they pointed out that there is no clear distinction between PM thus, there is a limited number of studies assessing the re- spective health impacts. portance of the more advanced measures (in addition to PMmass fractions) are to some extent inconclusive. One reason for this uncertainty is that there are so many associations of pact of PM is the associated oxidative stress when the parti- cles are inhaled (e.g. see Gao et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). A possible explanation for the health effects from PM is based (Gao et al., 2020). One prominent emerging area is the evaluation of long- term, multi-decadal concentrations and meteorology on a sufﬁcient spatial resolution. Long-term and lifetime expo- sures are known to be more important in terms of human health, compared with short-term exposures. Comprehensive data sets are therefore needed, which will include multi- sets have already been reported (Kukkonen et al., 2018; Sid- et al., 2020; Siddika et al., 2020).

To analyse these questions, two methodologies have been de- veloped: cost–effectiveness analyses and cost–beneﬁt analy- ses.

Sim- strategies, the changes are not assessed or monetized.

A possibility is to use the same ap- proach as with air pollution; i.e. estimate the marginal dam- does not lead to useful results. Uncertainties are too high and timation of impacts. An alternative approach to estimating marginal damage costs is to use marginal abatement costs. A basic law of envi- ronmental economics is that for pollution control a pareto- age costs (MDCs) are equal to marginal abatement costs (MACs). Thus, if MAC at the pareto-optimal state are known, they could be used instead of the MDCs. However, the pareto-optimal state is not known if MDCs are not known. But one could use an environmental aim that is universally optimal solution in the view of society and then estimate the MACs to reach this aim, which is then used for the assess- ment. This approach was ﬁrst proposed by Baumol and Oates (1971). so-called Paris Agreement, which was agreed on at the 2015 by a large number of countries, the most important aim was could be used as the basis for generating MACs. Bachmann (2020) has carried out a literature research of MDCs and MACs for GHG emissions.

Secondly, the marginal avoidance costs per tonne of avoided carbon are re- duced, especially for the period 2020–2035. The reason is later more expensive measures like producing and using fu- els that are produced from renewable electricity (power to X) will have a lower effect on air pollution reduction. In the following an example is shown where an efﬁcient cli-mate protection measure gets inefﬁcient if air pollution is in- cluded in the assessment. This example is the use of small wood ﬁrings in cities. Wood ﬁrings are climate friendly but that for wood ﬁrings that are operated in cities, the damage of gas emissions.

There are of course cross-cutting needs that are a prerequisite to further air quality research and de- dations for further research. There is a progressively important need to move from static annual inventories to those that are dynamic in terms of activ- ity patterns and of higher temporal resolution. This is driven and because there is an increasing availability of online ob- munity efforts are necessary for identifying and reducing un- certainties in emissions that have a large impact on the result- from source apportionment methods. One gap is the evaluation of agricultural emissions, which are still poorly understood, and improvements will support co-beneﬁts. While considerable effort has been devoted to es- timating NO xemissions, there are still uncertainties in the es- timation of VOC emissions.

Ensemble simulations have proven to be success- complementary hybrid approaches have been explored for multi-scale applications (Galmarini et al., 2018). O3), has motivated the coupling of urban- and regional-scale senting multiscale dynamical and chemical processes, while maintaining realistic computational constraints (e.g. Tsegas al., 2021). 10.4 Interactions between air quality, meteorology, and climate Our review has highlighted the need to integrate predictions 2015; WMO, 2016). There are also continued improvements from higher-spatial-resolution modelling and interconnected multiscale processes, while maintaining realistic computa- tional times. Many advances have taken place in the de- velopment and use of coupled regional-scale meteorology– 2018a). These advances contribute to assess complex inter- actions between meteorology, emission, and chemistry, for CTM systems is still an evolving ﬁeld of research; it has ban observations (including meteorological, chemical, and hac, 2021).

Advanced approaches are needed to deposition over vegetation surfaces to further assess the ef- fectiveness of nature-based solutions to improve air quality in cities. 10.5 Air quality exposure and health Air-quality-related observations to support air quality health impact studies are heterogeneous; for many developing re- gions, such as Africa, ground-based monitoring is sparse or non-existent (Rees at al., 2019). The motivation is growing for an inter-disciplinary approach to assess exposure and the mote sensing measurements, including satellite data, with atmospheric chemical transport and urban-scale dispersion modelling. timescales. PM, which is one of the most health-relevant air pollutants, is associated with many health effects, such as all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and Stafoggia et al., 2013; Weinmayr et al., 2010). There have concentrations (PNCs), secondary organic PM, primary PM, metals, and toxic or hazardous pollutants. ponents has also stimulated further debate on the optimal concentration–response functions and on the necessity of (about 374 000 premature deaths) were linked to exposure PM 2:5exposure may have been considerably underestimated. The worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has raised global interest anisms are not yet clear and require concerted effort (e.g. Pisoni and Van Dingenen, 2020). There is also evidence that is also becoming clearer, where dynamic diurnal activity pat- macher et al. (2019), for example, has also demonstrated the importance of the movements of people to assess exposure. which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. 10.6 Air quality management and policy Integrated assessment of air pollution control policies has progressively developed over the last 2 decades and has been widely used as a tool for air quality management (e.g. EC, lution control in research projects has started to take account of climate change. Correspondingly, integrated assessment activities for climate protection have started to include im- ergy and Industrial Strategy, have also recommended an inte- 2019). Impact pathway approaches are also currently increas- Friedrich, 2019). This has an implication for epidemiologi- cal studies, which usually are based on correlation betweenmodelled or measured concentrations at outdoor locations Interdependence of air pollution and climatically active also shows that costs of meeting policy obligations for cli- eﬁts of reduced climate change are much smaller than the impacts caused by increased air pollution. This has been Some recent studies (e.g. Schmid et al., 2019) have provided evidence on the advantages of using costs and beneﬁts for grated assessments. fuel for ships has been reduced to 0.5 % worldwide (IMO, 2019). The EURO 6d norm has led to a signiﬁcant reduction Council has recently (in September 2020) agreed to reduce fossil fuels. However, there is one exception: small wood (e.g. Kukkonen et al., 2020b). While direct combustion emissions are expected to de- eas that pose challenges for air quality management are the (especially ammonium nitrates).

Gorham’s researches,like those of Smith a century before, were met by what at large. It was not until 1967 and 1968 when Svante Oden Committee Report (Ode ´n1968 ) that the acid rain problem was brought to both public and scientiﬁc considerations.The report included a huge body of scientiﬁc and policy- relevant evidence that long-distance transport and deposi- tion of acidifying pollutants were causing signiﬁcant environmental and ecological impacts, even in countries authors. The report included a broad environmentalassessment of the sulphur emission problem including sources, atmospheric and surface water chemistry, and included scenarios and estimated costs for environmental damage and control; in fact it was probably the ﬁrst full systems analysis of an environmental problem. In the report, a ﬁrst estimate was made of the relative were also made of the effects of sulphur emissions on 14r1.pdf ) regional air pollution was explicitly mentioned research, Nordforsk, was asked to plan and developmethodologies for the investigation.

Further studies have supported the role and for the ﬁrst time particulate matter was included in aninternational protocol (Reis et al. 2012 ). 1999, it was realised that for some pollutants under the AirConvention, emission control needed to be considered over alone. Ozone was of particular importance, since long-termobjectives in the form of critical levels and public health Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) was set upunder the Convention in 2004, with a primary objective to quantify the intercontinental transport of pollutants. The Climate change has for more than a decade become an acidity. Such maps have played an important role for illustrating outcomes of future policies as well as of actions taken (from Maas and Grennfelt 2016 ) Fig. 5 Links between sources and effects used as an illustration in the 123/C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en854 Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 policy. In many cases, the emission sources are the same and there are obvious co-beneﬁts (and some trade-offs) in interest is the option to decrease short-term temperatureincrease through control measures directed towards atmo- balance in the atmosphere have been named Short Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs). SLCPs thus also includecompounds that are cooling the atmosphere, i.e. small secondary aerosols, e.g. sulphate particles. Recent research has focused on a better understanding of these compounds’contribution to both air pollution and climate as well as on Sand et al. 2016 ). Reactive nitrogen species are another group of com- of the century. Around 2006 several initiatives were takenin Europe, including a special task force on Reactive was considered both as a traditional atmospheric pollutant molecular nitrogen again, was introduced (Galloway et al.2003 ). The studies have pointed to the importance of the driver, and monitoring programmes were set up both in the National Atmospheric Deposition programme (NADP) started in 1976 and is still running. Both countries have taken part in the Air Convention activities and have signedmost of the protocols and achieved decreases in SO 2 emissions of the order of 80% between 1980 and 2015. TheUS has however taken a different approach with respect topolicy in comparison to Europe. Instead of developing a strategy based on integrated assessment modelling, it was INTERACTIONS rain and transboundary air pollution that have become effects to ecosystems), development of bridging concepts that have served the implementation of strategies, andﬁnally the dynamics in the science–policy interactions. ecosystem effects has been a key for understanding thecauses, impact, and trends in acid rain, both in Europe and (Table 2). The original EMEP network has since the start system. The originally established simple monitoring sta- tions have over time been complemented with moreadvanced monitoring, and some stations are today advanced atmospheric chemistry platforms with continuous collection of a multitude of atmospheric parameters (Fig. 6). The EMEP database is nowadays widely used for modelling. EMEP has also become a model for monitoring networks related to other geographical regions, conven-tions, and purposes. One example is the acid deposition monitoring network in East Asia (EANET). It is obvious that having a qualiﬁed centre for data collection and stor-age, standardisation, and intercalibration of methods has open nature is part of the success. The ﬁnancial support toEMEP, regulated through a separate protocol, has been monitoring activities. EMEP and was organised through so-called InternationalCooperative Programmes (ICPs). Separate programmes were set up for forests, waters, vegetation (primarily ozone), materials, and integrated monitoring.

The concept, ﬁrst discussed in 1982, was taken from the original idea to application quite quickly duringthe 1980s. The Swedish expert Jan Nilsson was a key makers, the concept gained the legitimacy on which poli-cies were developed. According to Jan Nilsson, it all have a sounder base for emission control, something thatcould express the long-term objectives for emission control policies. The concept was ﬁrst met by scepticism, not least loads were included in the plans for the next rounds of thesulphur and nitrogen protocols in 1988, it changed the way the Air Convention operated.

From the strategies strictly directed at ecosystem effects, the approach is now All the bridging concepts are to varying degrees it is important to keep transparency and conﬁdence in the underlying data and to scientiﬁcally evaluate and scrutinisethem. This is particularly important for the IAMs, which are the ﬁnal step in a chain of inputs (Fig. 8). The models have often been criticised, not least from industry and otherstakeholders that are questioning the priorities that result model calculations, has, however, been transparent, andcountries and stakeholders have always had the option to their own negotiation positions. Forming science–policy credibility crucially important to maintain scientiﬁc credibility. The close involvement of scientists has been a signature of the Air Convention. Scientists have always had a role at thepolicy meetings, communicating results from basic scien- a way that has been understandable and useful for thepolicy work. The role of the scientists has been as honest and observations of new problems have also been impor- tant, and have resulted in repeated changes in the framingsof the Air Convention to adapt to new situations: going interplay between the two communities has in this waybeen developed and maintained over time. Another factor is the building of networks. The strong during these four decades of the Convention is built on emissions in a cost-effective way. FUTURE CHALLENGES New approaches necessary International air pollution control is by many considered as a success story. However, the success is in many ways and development /C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en 123Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 859 industrialised countries (including Japan and Australia), where emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, VOCs, and some other compounds have been decreasedsigniﬁcantly (Maas and Grennfelt 2016 ). But even in the areas, where air pollution has been a top priority for several decades, air pollution remains a problem. Ecosystemeffects, which were the main reason for the establishment of the Convention, are to some extent reduced, but the emissions of ammonia have so far only been reduced by20–30% in Europe and even less in North America. Looking at health effects, it is difﬁcult to talk about suc- cess, when hundreds of thousands of inhabitants on bothcontinents are predicted to meet an earlier death due to air pollution. But the problem is even larger and more urgent when looking outside the traditional industrialised world. The focus is today on the large urban regions in the countries that are facing rapid population growth and industrialisation.Although large efforts now are being made to decrease sul- phur emissions in China—the world’s leading sulphur emitter—major challenges remain. In India and several othercountries, sulphur emissions are still increasing. Estimates airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/ ). It is assumed that ﬁne particles (PM2.5) are a main cause for the health effects. The new and great challenge is therefore to control air pol-lution in relation to health risks, in particular by decreasing exposure to the small particles. There is, however, a risk that control measures will only concentrations of particles have occurred during recentyears. At ﬁrst, these episodes were considered to be caused essentially by local emissions. More thorough analysis has, however, shown that they were to a large extent caused byregional emissions and buildup of high concentrations over Similar situations are also often encountered in urban are, as previously mentioned, also linked to interconti- nental and hemispheric scales. It is also obvious that the research communities within together. Health aspects are of importance both from airpollution and climate change perspectives, and heat wavescarry poor air quality as winds are often very low and the atmospheric boundary layer stagnant. During heat waves, and impacts on radiation balances. Modelling is a scientiﬁcarea where much progress has been made and where has allowed integration of atmospheric chemistry into theclimate models formulated as Earth system models, cou- simultaneously. The modelling approach can be further developed when observations are designed to map Earthsystem component boundaries to understand and quantify the ﬂows and interactions between different compartments, global-scale concepts such as ‘‘planetary boundaries’’ and ‘‘trajectories of the Earth system vs. planetary thresholds’’have been developed (Rockstro ¨m et al. 2009 ; Steffen et al. 2018 ). Solutions are available; driving forces and investments are lacking In 2016, the Air Convention launched a scientiﬁc report situation within the UNECE region was updated (Maas andGrennfelt 2016 ). The report also presented future chal- lems. It also showed that solutions are available for most ofthe identiﬁed problems at affordable costs below the health and ecosystem beneﬁts of the control actions. Even if solutions are available, many parts of the world are facing large problems in implementing them. There are several reasons, but often there is a lack of knowledge and resources. This is particularly true in many developingcountries. Another reason is the lack of political interest. Air pollution is still not of top priority among politicians, even if there is overwhelming evidence that air pollution isone of the most common causes of shortened life (e.g., industry and agriculture) are forming strong lobbyingforces delaying actions. 123/C211The Author(s) 2019 www.kva.se/en860 Ambio 2020, 49:849–864 Air pollution is a problem that cannot be seen in isola- will be a win–win solution.

It is tional Law Commission, under which a proposal for a Lawfor the Protection of the Atmosphere has been prepared (http://legal.un.org/ilc/summaries/8_8.shtml ) but in the current international atmosphere there is a lack of politicalsupport to implement it. Our hope is that the situation will change soon—the initiative is too important to fail. The UN has put forward a very strong agenda in order to pollution is an integral part of several of the SGDs, like water. Climate change is a very signiﬁcant common and cross-cutting factor. The Air Convention has taken some steps in promoting well-developed structure, it has taken a role of making surethat international organisations having air pollution on its agenda are aware of each other and to invite to further collaboration and development. Initiatives are taken bothwithin the formal Convention structure and through dedi- which has proven successful in linking scientiﬁc evidence, monitoring, and integrated assessment modelling directed These new international initiatives have a strong emphasis on policy development. The experience from the50 years of international air pollution development is the value of well-deﬁned scientiﬁc objectives and activities supporting policy. The increased interest from WHO andUN Environment is welcome and there are expectations of situation in many parts of the world. However, for theseorganisations, air pollution is just one of several priority organisations are likely able to set up advanced infras-tructures with respect to emission inventories, monitoring, and its components, air pollution being an important part.This is in line with the WMO strategic plan and with fast tres like The European Centre for Medium Range WeatherForecast (ECMWF).

Today we have more ence. It is also important to mobilise new generations ofdedicated policymakers. Unfortunately, we also see that politicians often are questioning science and seeing science which hopefully will not occur in the future. Instead wehope that it was an eye-opener and that industry instead can cleaner atmosphere. FINAL REMARKS industry, and the public worked together, the basis wasformed for the successful control of, what was considered, of the last century. We learnt from experience that science-based policy advice worked well when the best available knowledge was provided, and used to understand the speciﬁc problems, generate, and evaluate the policy optionsand monitor the outcomes of policy implementation.However, the world does not look the same today, and there are lessons to be learnt. Most important is thebuilding of mutual trust between science advisers and policymakers, and that both communities are honest about advice works best when it is guided by the ideal of co - tists and policymakers (SAPEA 2019 ).

Fussell let alone the health-based World Health Organisation has been a substantial increase in ﬁndings that particulate matter (PM) air pollution is not only points, but is also associated with a broader number of disease outcomes. Data strongly suggest that effects have no threshold within the studied range of ambient background concentrations and that they follow a mostly linear concentration–response function. Hav- ing ﬁrmly established this signiﬁcant public health problem, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is in ambient PM that affects health and to understand the underlying biological basis of toxicity by identifying mechanistic pathways—information toring, forecasting and reporting that exploits increas- ingly sophisticated information systems. Improving air quality is a considerable but not an intractable challenge. Translating the correct scientiﬁc evidence into bold, realistic and effective policies undisputedly has the potential to reduce air pollution so that it no health. awareness /C1Air quality communication Introduction Historical perspective Air pollution is now fully acknowledged to be a signiﬁcant public health problem, responsible for a growing range of health effects that are well docu- conducted in many regions of the world.

This in turn has led to a speculative link to the daily inhalation of smoke inconﬁned spaces from fuels used for warmth, cooking and lighting. Leaping forward through history to Victorian London, the billowing smoke and sulphur diox- ide (SO 2) from domestic and industrial coal burning, meteorological phenomenon as a spectacular mani- smog on sunlight gave London magniﬁcent breadth notoriously toxic air became a world-famous institu- stagnant weather conditions that trapped combustion 4000–12,000 deaths and an enormous increase in respiratory and cardiovascular complications (Logan1953 ; Bell and Davis 2001 ).

Modern-day air pollution On recounting such progress, it is especially disap- quality, not solely within the UK but in many urbanareas around the world, have miserably stalled. We build up—and it is during such episodes that suscep-tible individuals (e.g. those with asthma, COPD or heart disease) may undergo an acute exacerbation requiring increased medication or admission to hos-pital.

The latest estimate from the WHO reported that in 2012, approximately 3.7 million people died from outdoor urban and rural sources(WHO 2014 ). The cause of deaths was broken down as follows: ischaemic heart disease (40 %), stroke are based not only on a greater understanding of thediseases caused by poor air quality, but also more accurate exposure assessment that utilises sophisti- cated measurement and modelling technology. Ofnote, the overall mortality estimate more than doubles deaths stem from cardiovascular disease. is found in the low- and middle-income countries of the developing nations of these areas. However, theproblem is very much a global one. Focusing on Europe, air pollution is again the biggest environment countries were estimated at 203,000 and 280,000,respectively (WHO 2014 ). In recent years (2010–2012) the proportion of the urban population 10 and PM 2.5concentrations exceeded that was 21 and EU urban population exposure to PM concentrations above the WHO AQG (WHO 2006 ) is signiﬁcantly peans is reduced, on average, by about 8.6 monthsowing to PM 2.5pollution (WHO 2013b ), whilst traditional health impact assessment methods used in 123 concentrations were reduced to the WHO AQG annual level (Fig. 2). signiﬁcant contribution to mortality. Current (2008)data estimate that if the effect of PM 2.5air pollution is considered by itself, it is responsible for at least UK, with mortality rate estimates from long-term PM London boroughs (PHE 2014 ). Upon comparing commonly acknowledged mortality risks, it has been estimated that a 10 lg/m3reduction in ambient PM 2.5pollution (roughly equivalent to eradicating all anthropogenic particles) would have a larger endpoints has been subject to intense study, resulting 2.5and PM 10, with nega- tive impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health following both short-term and chronic exposures.Furthermore, data strongly suggest that effects have no 2.5background concentration–response function (WHO 2013a ).

Improved air quality and improved health We now also have consistent evidence that a reduction sustained intervention (mainly regulatory actions) is associated with improvements in public health. In theUSA, Pope et al. ( 2009 ) used data from the 51 cities long-term PM 2.5data are available. It was reported that reduction in PM 2.5concentration between 1980 and 2000 was strongly associated with 2.7 year overallincreases in life expectancy that occurred during that period (Fig. 3). Evidence has also been demonstrated 2002—a period when the annual average PM 10 concentration decreased by 5–6 lg/m3. This reduction in particle levels was associated with attenuation in theannual rate of decline of lung function (Downs et al. 2007 ). Using the same cohort, Schindler et al. ( 2009 ) 123 10 was associated with improved respiratory health(reduced incidence of chronic cough, bronchitis,common cold, nocturnal dry cough and conjunctivitis health of the Swiss children occurred following optimal air quality management.

Black carbon 2013a ), the health effects of BC particles have also initiatives have conﬁrmed that sufﬁcient epidemio- logical evidence exists to link short-term (daily) admissions. Evidence is also conclusive that long- term (annual) BC exposure is associated with all-causeand cardiopulmonary mortality. Although distinct mechanistic effects have not been identiﬁed from toxicological studies, suggesting that BC may not be adirect toxic component of ﬁne PM, it is hypothesised beyond. Furthermore, in that short-term studies showthat health effect associations with BC were more robust than those with PM 2.5or PM 10, although BC particles may not constitute a causal agent, it is theopinion that they may well serve as a better indicator of harmful particulate substances (e.g. organics) from Organic carbonOC is a very complex and heterogenous mixture of As a consequence, it is a huge challenge to identify thepotential toxicity of speciﬁc OC constituents and in fact evidence is currently insufﬁcient to distinguish between the toxicity of primary and secondary organicaerosols. Studies are, however, generating increasing endpoints. Ostro et al. ( 2010 ) has also observed associations between long-term exposure to organic monary mortality. Inorganic secondary aerosols Epidemiological evidence continues to accumulate on the short-term effects of sulphate on cardiovascular 2012 ).

In addition to trafﬁc density per se, it is not surprising thereforethat the greatest health impacts appear to be associated to humans based on sufﬁcient evidence that it is linked 123 toxicity and health consequences of roadside PM have focused on DEPs, the non-exhaust sources are attract- health effects is largely ignored at the regulatory level Riediker et al. 2004 ). Mechanisms of PM toxicity The well-established evidence that PM pollution contributes to an array of health outcomes has resulted mechanistic pathways. Although there remains much short- and long-term PM 2.5exposure with mortality and morbidity has evolved rapidly and continues to doso. For example, in investigating subclinical physio- logical changes, epidemiological research has ﬁbrinogen—subtle responses that have been consis- to study mechanistic pathways and physiological endpoints related to adverse effects following DEPexposure is the use of controlled exposure studies in environmentally relevant DE exposure experiments, combined with cardiovascular measurements, BAL and bronchial biopsy have revealed well-deﬁnedsystemic, pulmonary and cardiac responses involving a variety of cellular and molecular perturbations. It is probable that associations between the various con-stituents of PM and health effects are the result of nisms. Current evidence does, however, support a tion, translocation of particle constituents and an cardiovascular and obstructive pulmonary diseases (Kelly and Fussell 2015 ; Fig. 4).

Studies and initiatives examining public awareness and understanding in this area have yielded mixed warnings associated with ground level O 3do have a air quality. Bell et al. ( 2004 ) have also hypothesised induced mortality observed across US communities.Other research has concluded that both awareness of understanding of air quality information are lackingamongst the public (Bickerstaff and Walker 2001 ; European Commission (EC) conducted a ﬂash Euro-barometer to gain a greater insight into the views of the disorders, cardiovascular diseases and asthma/allergy were 87, 92 and 87 % respectively. Factors determining awareness Other than the availability of sufﬁcient information governing how aware individuals are about the quality Fig. 4 Biological pathways linking PM exposure withoxidative and inﬂammatory pathways in the lung and cardiovasculature640 Environ Geochem Health (2015) 37:631–649 123 are likely to include understanding, perception and a standing of what is undoubtedly a complex science. Unlike other environmental risks that are routinelycommunicated such as UV and heat, overall air quality encompasses several primary pollutants as well as secondary products owing to atmospheric transforma-tion. Rural areas for example are very often considered times, O concentrations of nitrogen oxides to sequester rural O3. A lack of vested interest in the topic is also possible amongst ‘healthy’ people, less likely to have pollution and/or increasing medication may bring.Indeed, where research has indicated that individuals are aware of air quality warnings and take responsive actions, larger responses were observed for moresusceptible groups or carers thereof (McDermott et al. is another factor inﬂuencing the public understanding data generated by monitoring sites and communicated via an advisory service (Shooter and Brimblecombe2009 ). Several studies have investigated the relation- ship between perceived and measured outdoor air (Atari et al. 2009 ), others have found little or no rather than the advisory service, drove the response.Some epidemiological researchers have also indicated that self-reported health status is associated with et al. 2008 ).Information services Public awareness is fundamentally dependent upon optimal air pollution monitoring, forecasting and reporting. Many countries have air quality monitoringnetworks that are structured around a particular country’s regulatory obligation to report monitored lutants, air quality modelling systems and meteoro- logical data are also processed to create a national airquality index (AQI). Again in line with national legislation, an AQI communicates pollution levels and short term; Table 1). These data are used by the public Another information tool is provided by accessible air tion events via a computer/tablet (websites, email, social media) or phone (texts, apps) (London AirQuality Network; City of London). These are becom- ing increasingly informative and engaging, allowing example, providing low pollution journey planners to reduce exposure (Fig. 5). New developments Whilst monitoring, forecasting and reporting of air quality have become increasingly sophisticated and 123 systems sourced by ﬁxed site monitoring stations are monitors was primarily limited to industries associ- children (Spira-Cohen et al. 2011 ). Now we are witnessing an emerging role for inexpensive, portable, easy-to-use personal monitoring devices (Austen by such sensors is not currently robust enough to compliment data for ofﬁcial monitoring networks, there is undoubtedly a need for more dynamicmeasures of time-activity patterns in relation to low-cost air quality sensors, also has the potential to Added to their ubiquitous technology, the penetrationof these phones is unrivalled in demographics, possibilities in the communication of individual research setting, novel smartphone-based software that records people’s movements and physical activitylevels in the urban environment and is integrated with spatial–temporal maps of air pollution is already being Discussion fore that health effects of PM—one of the pollutantsdeemed most dangerous to health—are well docu- mented.

DEPs are nowclassiﬁed as carcinogenic, and an increasing number of studies are investigating the potential for particulate We now also appreciate that there is no evidence of a studies are showing associations between PM and 2.5. Correspondingly, reductions in population exposure to air pollution appreciable beneﬁts in terms of increased life expectancy and improvements to respiratory health. Having ﬁrmly established associations between ambient PM and adverse health effects, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is inambient PM that affects health—information that in characteristics or sources to be deﬁnitely identiﬁed comparing and synthesising data from existing studies is therefore needed before concluding thatadditional indicators (be they BC or UFPs) have a toxicity by identifying pathways that ultimately link obstructive pulmonary diseases. 123 Evidence has emerged that (a) the burden of ambient PM pollution on health is signiﬁcant at relatively low concentrations, (b) there is no safelower limit and (c) effects follow a mostly linear concentration–response function, suggesting that pub- lic health beneﬁts will result from any reduction inconcentrations. As has been advocated many times before, interventions to reduce levels of particulate ment (environment, transport, energy, health, housing) related particulates means that forward-looking and integrated transport policies are critical for theimprovement of urban environments. Trafﬁc must be investment in clean and affordable public transport vehicles, lowering speed limits and enhancing cycle routes.

Based on and onwards. We show that: (1) The early policies, until 2005, were ineffective at reducing emissions; (2) During 2006–2012, new instruments which interact with political incentives were introduced in the 11th Five-Year Plan, and the national goal of reducing total sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions by 10% was in eastern China in 2013, air pollution control policies have been experiencing signiﬁcant changes on multiple fronts. In this work we analyze the different policy changes, the drivers of changes and key evolution have implications for future studies, as well as further reforming the management scheme 1. Introduction Air pollution in China has been very severe, causing huge health damages and social losses for a long time. In the meantime air pollution control polices have over the last couple of National large-scale polices have been initiated and implemented, such as the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (hereinafter the Action Plan) [ 1]. It is well known that energy (or more precisely coal) is the primary source of air pollution and carbon emissions in China, and the closely related energy and climate polices are also experiencing signiﬁcant changes. are immediately faced with difﬁculties. Research-based information is scattered in several lines of the and the policy-relevant discussions provided are broad, and from a national perspective (e.g., [ 2–4]). individual policies (e.g., [ 9–11]). There are recent Chinese empirical studies (e.g., [ 12–16]) and some some short commentaries (e.g., [17]), more detailed, systematic follow-ups are rarely seen. policies in China are experiencing profound changes. With China’s signiﬁcant role on air pollution, deep and up-to-date understanding of China’s air pollution policies is of great relevance. Moreover, as opportunities to learn from these experiences. The paper is structured as follows: the next two sections ﬁrst describe the air pollution status factors for policy changes and conclude by summarizing trends and challenges for the future. It is Air pollution is closely related to some other key challenges for China, e.g., climate change, energy most of the time period which this review covers, the air pollution control policy process in China has been relatively independent of climate or energy policy process. Recently this has changed and with 2. Air Pollution Status and Evolution In China, the major air pollution problems have been mainly attributable to coal burning and industry processes during the early stage of economic development. Recently vehicle emissions have pollutants (primary pollutants are directly emitted from certain sources; secondary pollutants are concentration has been observed, but a more complex, regional air pollution problem dominated by with different aerodynamic diameters) and ground level ozone (O 3) has emerged. Chinese economic growth has been powered by a coal-dominated surging fossil fuel consumption air pollution in China has been estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) to lead to totally offsetting China’s current annual GDP growth. “smoke and dust” in statistics yearbooks) have passed their peak and are diminishing (Figure 1a), and their concentrations have signiﬁcantly declined [ 19,20] (Figure 2a,c). Meanwhile, the less regulated per unit of GDP have declined (Figure 1b). emission intensity data is calculat ed based on the 1990 price in CNY. 1996–2014 [26–32] . For PM 2.5 and O 3 concentration, the situation is worsening [33].

Coal smoke mainly contains SO 2, (for example, vehicles were found to contribute to about 30%–56% of total Pearl River Delta regional NO x and Non-Methane VOC emissions [39,40] ) which were added to the previous problems [38].

Thus, SO 2, NO x, and VOCs will be transformed into PM 2.5more efﬁciently where O 3concentrations are higher due to increased rates of oxidation. stages: (1) In 1970–1990, the dominant contributing sources were big and small coal burning stoves widely used in power plants, industry, utilities and households.

On the national level coal burning is still dominant in contributing to the primary processes, are possibly ignorable [ 42]. Moreover, regional transmission also plays an important role [ 43]. In China the air pollution situation is severe, widely distributed, and the atmospheric chemical has to target all the major pollutants from different sources, and control measures have to be jointly designed and wisely combined. It is evident that China therefore faces different challenges than developed 3. Environmental Regulatory System The institutional composition and dynamics of the environmental regulatory system in China is governance foundation for later sections. The environment regulatory system in China is viewed environmental regulations have been weak and questionable during the past decades. As an illustrative summary, Figure 4 (discussed in more detail later) shows the institutional structures and the channels surrounding areas of the cities. On the national level coal burning is still dominant in contributing to site dust, industrial processes, are possibly ignorable [42]. Moreover, regional transmission also plays an important role [43]. In China the air pollution situation is severe, widely distributed, and the atmospheric chemical reactions complex. These characteristics indicate no easy solution and that any effective control strategy has to target all the major pollutants from different sources, and control measures have to be jointly designed and wisely combined. It is eviden t that China therefore faces different challenges a century. 3. Environmental Regulatory System The institutional composition and dynamics of the environmental regulatory system in China is governance foundation for later sections. The enviro nment regulatory system in China is viewed as environmental regulations have been weak and qu estionable during the past decades. As an Figure 4. Environmental governance in China.

Environmental governance in China. from central government (the red area in Figure 4) to jurisdictional-based local governments. secretary, mayor and vice-mayor) are the ones in charge of public affairs within their geographic the local government (orange area in Figure 4). As they are largely promotion driven, their limited attention and the tradeoffs in resource allocation are naturally inﬂuenced by the incentives given by the promotion mechanisms. Promotion of local ofﬁcials in China is a complicated “cadre evaluation” process in the Five-Year-Plan (FYP) framework (see, e.g., [ 8]). The FYPs are a cycle process starting from the release of goals are “administratively subcontracted” [ 44] to local governments. The bureaucratic personnel are be promoted or not. Some key characteristics of this process are: (1) the ones getting higher rankings are more likely to be promoted; (2) the strongest promotion incentive is concentrated on the local main leaders; and (3) though subcontracted tasks are numerous, covering most public areas, only economic development (e.g., GDP) is tracked and veto-track factors largely determine the evaluation ranking. A veto means that if the target is not fulﬁlled, there will deﬁnite be no chance for promotion, one example was birth control targets. Environmental protection is among the highly subcontracted jurisdictional obligations. However, for a long time it was not included in the two emphasized tracks of factors in the promotion assessment. Therefore the difﬁculties in its implementation are largely inherent and only in relatively rare cases compounded by the lack of capacity in EPBs, they hardly have a sufﬁcient ﬁscal budget and personnel for monitoring and enforcement. Weak implementation as the overall result of the constraints is not destined to persist though. When the rules of promotion are changed and the veto track factors begin to include environmental ones, local main leaders have to pay attention. When these factors start being measured in a way that leaders have to really implement the regulations. Further, when strong political pressure from the central government is perceived by local governments, the latter may even “over implement” and “innovatively implement”. 3.2. What Are the Environmental Policies? in Section 3.1. They are: (1) environmental laws, rules and standards; (2) national plans in the FYP and climate policies are also highly relevant to air pollution, but for a long time they were part of 3.2.1. Environmental Laws and Standards China has many environmental laws at different legislative levels. In 1978, the Third Chinese Wang has reviewed environment law in China and summarized them as covering every aspect of environment management, but to have low legislative quality, too many principles, being very basic and difﬁcult to actually enforce [48]. standards in China were established early, even in the 1980s, and then were ﬁxed or even loosened the winter between 2012 and 2013), these standards have been updated and signiﬁcantly strengthened. The current standards are largely in line with international ones and for power plants even more summarized based on standards available at Ministry of Environment (MEP) website [49]. 1992 GB13223-91 -2200–33003- 1996 GB13223-1996 1200–21004200–3300 650–1000 2004 GB13223-2003 400–2100 50–600 450– 11004 2012 GB13223-2011 50–200 20–30 100–200 1984 GB3841-83 - 200–600 - 1992 GB13271-91 1200–1800 100–400 - 2001 GB13271-2001 900–1200 80–350 - 2014 GB13271-2014 200–400 30–80 200–400 2000 GB18352.1-2001S 2.72 - - 0.97 - C 2.72 - - 0.97–1.36 0.14–0.2 2004 GB18352.2-2001S 2.2 - - 0.5 - C 1 - - 0.7–0.9 0.08–0.1 2007 GB18352.3-2005S 2.3 0.2 0.15 - - C 0.64 - 0.5 0.56 0.05 2010 GB18352.3-2005S 1 0.1 0.08 - - C 0.5 - 0.25 0.3 0.025 2017 GB18352.5-2013S 1 0.1 0.06 - 0.0045 C 0.5 - 0.18 0.23 0.0045 Table 1.

National Environmental Plans within the FYPs will have concrete chapters in the nationwide FYP , their goals will be more quantitatively articulated Among the many public area targets, the solid type is “mandatory” targets. They are guaranteed to be attained and implemented in advance [ 51]. These targets are decomposed and allocated to local became more speciﬁc and concrete in later FYPs [ 52]. The 11th FYP (2006–2010) is the milestone in During the past decades, ten speciﬁc conventional regulatory measures have been solidiﬁed. These measures are often referred to as “Old Three, New Five, Target Response and Total Emission Control” (Old Three refers to 1 to 3 of the list, and were solidiﬁed between 1972 and 1979, New Five refers to 4 to 8 and are solidiﬁed between 1980 and 1989. “Lao San Xiang, Xin Wuxiang, Mu Biao Ze Ren Generally when talking about environmental regulatory implementation in China, it is one or several of these measures being used: EIAs before their construction. In 2003 this measure was expanded to including planning EIAs. no longer restricted to excessive discharge. ranking information of about a hundred cities are made public. pollutants and information of discharge pipes are speciﬁed. are jointly planed, designed and operated, as an additional mechanism to the conventional independently performed way. of wastes in production, and conduct cleaner production audits and report to the relevant level are responsible for environmental protection in their jurisdiction and the responsible persons a certain cap are allocated to local governments/targeted enterprises. Early trials were in the 3.2.4. Special Actions outside the FYPs China is able to quickly respond to all kinds of “situations” (e.g., crisis, special needs, and Usually they are local, short-term administrative measures at any costs [ 58]. Sometimes, after a certain situation is subsided, parts of these measures will be adopted at regional or national level and even be integrated in later FYPs [ 6]. Some examples of special actions are the Environmental Law Enforcement Plan as triggered by the PM 2.5crisis. “State ideologies” in China are soft policies in the broad sense. On the surface they look like national planning. In terms of the possibility in deriving some concrete policies they may have very different results. World-known and thoroughly implemented state ideologies are “Focus on Economic Construction” and “Family Planning”. Historic experience shows that a dozen of environment-related The latest one is “Ecological Civilization”) largely accomplished their mission as slogans, but from their has become clearer over time [6]. 3.3. An Illustrative Summary remaining unchanged for 25 years, has been amended in 2014 and some of the new law articles are regarded as unprecedentedly strict [ 60]. Non-governmental actors, not shown in Figure 4, have been granted the legal power to claim environmental rights [61], hence their role is increasing. Based on previous trials focusing on eliminating industrial smoke and dust, the basic system of air pollution control was established in the Law on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric requirements; and (4) if the law is violated, ﬁnes with the maximum capped at 500,000 RMB (exchange rate: 1 USD = 8.28 RMB in 2000) shall be applied. Usually this is at most a small percentage of the reform in the subsequent decades. physical outcomes, the 3S and pollution fees. The reality of implementation of the 3S was puzzling. 3S over total ﬁxed assets kept around 5 ‰. If both were true it would imply that new ﬁxed investment went to less polluting industries, which is not supported by the ofﬁcial statistics [58]: Invest 3s Total invest dirty+Total invest clean =implementation rate o f 3S\u0002b 1+Total investclean Total investdirty=5‰(1) The pollution fee was a small levy on enterprises. Theoretically, its social efﬁcient level equals the marginal damage cost. However, in most industries pollution fee levels were much lower, even the average abatement costs of SO 2in coal ﬁred power plants were between 4 to 6 yuan/kg [ 62]). “Deal enforcement” [ 58] was in some cases the result, far from the original policy intention, with their own daily operations. 4.1.1. Some Fundamental Flaws Looking back on what actually happened before 2005, air pollution, severe though, was not regarded as an urgent social problem. The nature of the management regime was not so much a broad discharge. It did have positive regulatory effects, but to a larger extent became a fetter on subsequent policy adjustments. The limitations are clear: 1. The general principles of environmental rights and interests are absent. It lacks the concept that the atmospheric environmental capacity is natural capital, is scarce and has value. It does not have an ultimate regulatory aim to protect human health and enhance social welfare. 2. Inefﬁciencies are present. Air pollutants transmit and transform but the management is jurisdiction-based, therefore “leakage” and lack of regional coordination are predestined to Pollution fees are too low compared to the efﬁcient level. 3. Monitoring capacity as a basic regulatory element is not created, therefore all policy instruments designed based on the emission situation become ineffective. Estimated data with information 4. Credibility of the law and regulations is seriously challenged. The cost of breaking environmental laws is strikingly low [ 64].Legal liability theoretically exists, but judicial latitude of discretion is huge preserves an expectation that they are and will be tacitly permitted to be incompletely implemented. The Chinese central government is located in Beijing, where the air quality has long been notoriously bad. Unlike that in other places, in Beijing air pollution control was a political task efforts of Beijing were not enough to bring about any signiﬁcant air quality improvement. These efforts were not totally in vain, though, by providing important evidence; vehicle exhausts control, among all the measures, was found to contribute the most to concentration abatement potential of NO xand PM 2.5in Beijing [68]. Based on what happened until 2005 many studies, as summarized in [ 63], predicted that without The policies were the “total emission control on SO 2” and the closely relevant “energy saving” policy. reduction from the 2005 level was set as the national target. On energy saving, the target was a 20% reduction of energy consumption per unit of GDP from the 2005 level. National targets were upper assigned target. In the 12th FYP (2011–2015) these policies were maintained and extended. It should be noted that the national total control policies were initiated in the 9th FYP and further speciﬁed in the 10th FYP but back then the implementation and results were failures (see, e.g., [ 10]). In the 11th FYP , the implementation became remarkable and the targets were achieved. However the air quality improvements were insigniﬁcant. Then three key questions arise: (1) Why did the local industries? (3) Why the efforts are ineffective and inefﬁcient in improving air quality? These three questions are discussed in the following sections. the successful implementation of total control policies was that each province’s target became unprecedentedly “mandatory” and was linked to the veto track factors in cadre evaluation of local main leaders. If the annual target were not met, then the local leaders were ordered to rectify within do something if emission data could still be relatively easily adjusted. That was exactly what happened Field evidence shows that local governments did manipulate emission data [ 63]. The centralization of emission data management was another key element for local governments’ real implementation of data management was established, with the key feature that data is now controlled and veriﬁed by upper level agencies. Local EPBs only do data collection and report to regional supervision centers whose administrative ranks are higher than those of the provincial governments. The regional centers a “cumbersome” process. Field evidence shows that the details of the data examination and veriﬁcation were so sophisticated that the space for fabrication shrank signiﬁcantly. Finally, the annual emission reduction of a province was certiﬁcated by MEP and was used in cadre evaluation (details see, e.g., [ 63]). This centralized data management guaranteed that the assessment of local implementation was based on real efforts. sector emits the most SO 2and the abatement capacity was huge with “low hanging fruits” [ 6]. It was (and still is) composed of big and small units mostly belonging to ﬁve state owned enterprises (SOE) whose leaders are another track of bureaucratic personnel and have similar promotion incentives as local main leaders, therefore negotiations between the two are not that difﬁcult. The big units overall have limited heterogeneity and can be easily added the mature ﬂue gas desulfurization (FGD) For desulfurization in big units, the FGD facilities were quickly installed whereas their normal operation was later gradually realized along with the policy tightening. It was a price type instrument To phase out small power plant units and some other outdated enterprises was a forced process, and the public security bureau to guarantee the enforcement (the enforcement was guaranteed by the police force). In the 12th FYP , the targeted two emissions are SO 2plus NO X. SO 2is to be further abated. For NO X, it is the power plant sector who again takes the leading role of “denitrifying”. 4.2.3. Why the Efforts Are Ineffective and Inefﬁcient in Improving Air Quality? quality. Elementary atmospheric chemistry shows that the transformation from primary pollutants such as SO 2, NO Xand primary PM to secondary pollutants is complicated and is non-linear, as described in earlier sections. Therefore, when a single type of primary pollutant emission is reduced, might change, but not much. moment. SO 2transmits within a regional scope. The jurisdictional based management cannot promote inter-regional cooperation in abatement efforts (see, e.g., [ 7,73]). More developed places have higher demand for SO 2pollution abatement but their more aggressive efforts are partially offset by the transmitted amount from their less developed neighbors. Using SO 2inventory data from 2006 in jurisdictional management. were not exploited. For example, marginal pollutant abatement costs ($/ton) differ signiﬁcantly technologies, marginal abatement costs are considerably different. In other more heterogeneous sectors such as industrial boilers, space for cost saving is even larger. Moreover, the effect from geographical costs ($/ \u0016g\u0001m\u00003) in these territories are also different. The administrative allocation of reduction jointly reduce the abatement costs. To improve Beijing’s air quality for the 2008 Olympic Games was a solemn promise and was measures mentioned previously strictly implemented, more radical measures were gradually adopted after 2005 (see, e.g., [ 75]). Regional transported pollution was taken into account and during the Olympics multiple measures were implemented in surrounding territories including Tianjin, Hebei, dust and banning of straw burning [ 66]. To implement them everywhere was unrealistic, instead cost-effectiveness considerations. The Beijing Olympics air quality management, as the very ﬁrst one based on regional mechanism in China, was remarkably effective. Air quality in Beijing improved signiﬁcantly during and after the were attributable to plant closures and trafﬁc control (see, e.g., [ 75]) and such measures have also been The haze with its unprecedentedly high index of PM 2.5concentration and extremely low visibility was Beijing and Beijing EPB’s descriptive air pollution index were noticed and questioned [ 77], the health into a social crisis [78]. 2013 that China is not willing to and shall not “pollute ﬁrst and clean up later”, instead shall treat pollution with “iron ﬁsts” [ 79]. Subsequently the “iron ﬁsts” was unexceptionally used in ofﬁcial media and local government documents. The strong political will was further solidiﬁed in the 2014 government work report, “China shall punch hard to strengthen the prevention and control of pollution, and resolutely declare war against pollution” [80]. 20% and 15% Ten Tasks 7.

From this Action Plan various policies have emerged. Here we classify have been fully implemented, such as desulfurization, denitriﬁcation and dust precipitation of capacity. As vehicles are important contributors to NO x, the early retirement of old vehicles is also emphasized. The 12th FYP is coming to an end and its total emission control goals for major pollutants have already being achieved in advance or are about to be reached. plans have similar structure compared to the nation one, including ﬁrstly the provincial air quality improvement goals and then a list of measures. These goals are not explicitly linked to the highest weight given to air quality goals. Serious accountability is reﬂected by some recent in this grading system [81]. analysis: A common feature of these efforts is that uniﬁcation within regional scope is emphasized. Many standards are being updated, including air quality and heave pollution alerting index networks are being built. Key regions and major cities are required to establish their source Among the cities that have ﬁnished the analysis, results are similar with different shares among the main sources in different sectors [82]. 4. Regional cooperation mechanism is taking substantial steps: Based on previous experiences, in fuel quality and vehicle exhausts [83]. Equivalent (Mtce) by 2020 was chosen as a core strategy to address the ambient air pollution in China. The BTH, YRD and PRD regions are required to cap coal consumption by 2017. Similar to total emission control, annual coal reduction goals are subcontracted to provincial and municipal governments. “Coal to gas” in power plants was ﬁrst implemented in Beijing and quickly adopted by other places. However, currently (besides Beijing) most of them have suspended or canceled the initiative, mainly because natural gas is still scarce and costly in China.

In 2014 more than 8000 suspects were arrested in more than 2000 environmental criminal actions, an amount which is twice the number of cases in all the previous 10 years [ 86]. The Environment Protection Law was amended in 2014. From the legal liability perspective, ﬁnes on illegal discharge are now imposed consecutively on found applicable to several new penalty measures have been doubling and tripling on a monthly base [ 81]. Other speciﬁc laws on air, water and soil are under revision but the process is not as 7. Public participation and civil society’s role is increasing: Litigation qualification for non-governmental actors is deﬁned in the new law. Around 300 environmental “social organizations” are qualiﬁed as records of enterprises’ penalties. In some provinces, the EPBs are reported as mobilizing in 8. Price and quantity type market instruments are being simultaneously designed in full swing: For pollutants, pollution fees are to be changed into pollution taxes as reflected in the Environmental permits are implemented in pilot provinces and cities. Primary markets are established, whereas transactions of permits in secondary markets are not frequent [ 87]. Carbon taxes and tradable permits, though not directly targeting air pollution, obviously are relevant. There are Commission (NDRC) has been leading the preparation of tradable carbon permits. The Ministry of Finance has been involved in designing a carbon tax. Theoretical research does not provide realize ﬁrst best abatement levels when the two types coexist. Rather it is a case by case situation empirical research is needed in the current Chinese context. Knowledge beyond economics is also important. For example, the current local tax collecting system in China may be used for 5. Discussion Until now we have seen three major changes of air pollution control policies with signiﬁcant suggest that China is undergoing fundamental reform on her own initiative. Rather they, as good the repeated and circle governance phenomena from history to present in China has made important and recentralization of power, which is one theme of dynamics in the principal-agent relationship which should have been seen as a public good provision, was decentralized and administrative subcontracted together with other economic development tasks. Implementation was bound to fail the system largely unchanged, the power to manage and verify the data was partially recentralized to the principal central government by the new data management system and then implementation was guaranteed, though full of distortions and inefﬁciencies. The effective while short-lived regional air quality management during the mega events is or pros and cons, it is an important supplement to China’s regular governance system [ 57]. When there is a special situation of need, campaign style regulations can be very effective by quickly mobilizing attention and resource are gathered to fulﬁll certain short-term goals. The temporary changes in air quality management in mega events are such a process. neighbors [ 90]. However, after two years since the crisis, all kinds of new policies are still emerging and air quality management is likely to experience major changes. From what have happened it of “informal” governance has been shrinking and the governance is adapting itself to the changes in way such as to declare that “all is well” or perform “informal” measures. Governance is pushed 5.2. Macro Trends That Have Taken Shape Changes in air quality management in China are the “tip of the iceberg” of an ongoing profound patterns. Based on what is going on, some macro level trends are taking shape: is that it has become one of the top priorities in all the efforts belonging to the construction of is an “extremely important and urgent mission” as recently reconﬁrmed by the central power. A red line on environmental quality is also set by the central leadership, that air, water and soil form the foundation of the ongoing changes. 2. Public participation and the civil society’s role are increasing: “Environment in China has severely deteriorated” has already become an irreversible public consensus. Along with the income increase right-defending actions, after a dozen of years of small scale but unremitting pursuit, have obtained breakthroughs recently. Environmental litigation qualiﬁcation for non-governmental actors is rights. Governments’ attitude also changes. Local EPBs are becoming willing to disclose more such as monitoring, atmospheric modeling, source apportionment, health risk assessments have were not utilized outside academia, except during the several mega events. Now there is an damage liabilities, etc., become possible. This is to some extent the infrastructure for most of future policy designs. development: Air pollution control is used as the breakthrough point of environmental protection reform, which in turn is used by the central power as a leading factor to reshape the economy and such as cap on coal are being taken to ensure the achievement of the quantitative climate promises. 6. Conclusions important topic. implementation. A typical example is the big controversy surrounding the revision of the Law on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution (the revision was ﬁnished on the 29 August 2015, and the new law comes into force from 2016). This revision is originally aimed as an effort to solidify Based on the experiences of the total control policies, people learned that implementation and and the centralized data management system. The legislation committee has the intention to solidify propose the elimination of the total control measures. Total control is just one abatement measure and is not a quality based design. The 11th FYP experience has proved that insuring the implementation of Most of the shared experts’ ideas are summarized in [ 94]. First and foremost, an ultimate subject should penetrate throughout the law rather than only being mentioned in the beginning, which is evaluation and liability should center on the quality based themes and goals. Some recent important based information and the possibility to make environmental civil rights claim based on this quality information. Experts’ ideas are not novel compared to international practice and are to some extent self-evident from the basic environmental economics and law perspective. The reason why it is still is that the latter means to abandon, or at least major reform, the existing total control data accounting MEP and local governments are already familiar with. Though it may not be realized in the near future, we have good reason to predict a revolutionary social welfare by protecting human health through improving air quality. Therefore, air quality based and health risk based management scheme is the general direction. For now, as always, the ﬁnal format of the revised law might not be fundamentally critical since environmental governance in China is and Acknowledgments: This research is supported by the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Pollution Control.

While this paper is not an exhaustive review of all research areas in the ﬁeld of air quality, we have selected key topics that we feel are important from air quality research and policy health assessment, and air quality management and policy. In conducting the review, speciﬁc objectives were portance for air quality policy. The original concept of this review was borne at the International Conference outdoor sources. There is a growing need to have integrated air pollution and related observations from both ground-based and remote sensing instruments, including in particular those on satellites. The research should also capitalize on the growing area of low-cost sensors, while ensuring a quality of the measurements which are are signiﬁcant feedbacks, such as those related to aerosols, chemistry, and meteorology.

The introduction of the automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS), long-range identiﬁcation and tracking (LRIT), and vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) have enabled tracking of individual ships in unprecedented detail. These navigational local and global scales. Currently, ship emission models using AIS data as an ac- tivity source are most popular. They can have accurate infor- models. Ship emission data are available on a global grid new routes in the Arctic. and departure following the same AIS-based approach as for at berth are estimated based on ship type and size, but with to comply with at least three options. The ﬁrst of these is fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment systems, which are commonly used (estuaries, ports) or water exchange is slow (e.g. the Baltic Sea) (Teuchies et al., 2020). The use of low-sulfur or LNG fuels is a fossil-based solu- tion, unless the fuel was made using renewable or fully syn- much on the engine type selected. Methane, methanol, and ammonia are three fuels which three fuels are also suitable for use in internal combustion engines as well as fuel cells. All three are hydrogen carri- els and have hydrogen production as an intermediary step.

This approach is based on the assumptions that the regional contribution is constant at regional background. The CMB is based on known source composition proﬁles and measured receptor species concen- source proﬁles, which ideally are from the region where the receptor is located and that should be contemporary with the underpinning ambient air measurements.

(iii) Research recommendations for deciphering the impacts of various particulate matter properties which would also include sufﬁciently accurate information on particle size distributions and chemical composition. et al. (2018) reported that there is a severe lack of epidemi- ological studies investigating the health impacts originating they pointed out that there is no clear distinction between PM thus, there is a limited number of studies assessing the re- spective health impacts. portance of the more advanced measures (in addition to PMmass fractions) are to some extent inconclusive. One reason for this uncertainty is that there are so many associations of pact of PM is the associated oxidative stress when the parti- cles are inhaled (e.g. see Gao et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). A possible explanation for the health effects from PM is based (Gao et al., 2020). One prominent emerging area is the evaluation of long- term, multi-decadal concentrations and meteorology on a sufﬁcient spatial resolution. Long-term and lifetime expo- sures are known to be more important in terms of human health, compared with short-term exposures. Comprehensive data sets are therefore needed, which will include multi- sets have already been reported (Kukkonen et al., 2018; Sid- et al., 2020; Siddika et al., 2020).

An alternative approach to estimating marginal damage costs is to use marginal abatement costs. A basic law of envi- ronmental economics is that for pollution control a pareto- age costs (MDCs) are equal to marginal abatement costs (MACs). Thus, if MAC at the pareto-optimal state are known, they could be used instead of the MDCs. However, the pareto-optimal state is not known if MDCs are not known. But one could use an environmental aim that is universally optimal solution in the view of society and then estimate the MACs to reach this aim, which is then used for the assess- ment. This approach was ﬁrst proposed by Baumol and Oates (1971). so-called Paris Agreement, which was agreed on at the 2015 by a large number of countries, the most important aim was could be used as the basis for generating MACs. Bachmann (2020) has carried out a literature research of MDCs and MACs for GHG emissions. Based on this review, are used here as the basis for the calculation of marginal of 3 % a\u00001, social costs of CO 2;eqto be used in 2020 would climate protection is foreseen, a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants is foreseen; thus, taking both air pollution con- prove the efﬁciency of such measures. are different from the ranking in separate plans is shown in by transport in the EU have been assessed with an integrated assessment.

The reason is later more expensive measures like producing and using fu- els that are produced from renewable electricity (power to X) will have a lower effect on air pollution reduction. In the following an example is shown where an efﬁcient cli-mate protection measure gets inefﬁcient if air pollution is in- cluded in the assessment. This example is the use of small wood ﬁrings in cities. Wood ﬁrings are climate friendly but that for wood ﬁrings that are operated in cities, the damage of gas emissions.

There are of course cross-cutting needs that are a prerequisite to further air quality research and de- dations for further research. There is a progressively important need to move from static annual inventories to those that are dynamic in terms of activ- ity patterns and of higher temporal resolution. This is driven and because there is an increasing availability of online ob- munity efforts are necessary for identifying and reducing un- certainties in emissions that have a large impact on the result- from source apportionment methods. One gap is the evaluation of agricultural emissions, which are still poorly understood, and improvements will support co-beneﬁts. While considerable effort has been devoted to es- timating NO xemissions, there are still uncertainties in the es- timation of VOC emissions. These uncertainties have direct contributions from secondary organic aerosols to regional ties is the estimation of VOC proﬁles in terms of the chemi- a shift has occurred to both low-sulfur and carbon-neutral or non-carbon fuels. airborne non-exhaust emissions is becoming more and more cles.

Advanced approaches are needed to deposition over vegetation surfaces to further assess the ef- fectiveness of nature-based solutions to improve air quality in cities. 10.5 Air quality exposure and health Air-quality-related observations to support air quality health impact studies are heterogeneous; for many developing re- gions, such as Africa, ground-based monitoring is sparse or non-existent (Rees at al., 2019). The motivation is growing for an inter-disciplinary approach to assess exposure and the mote sensing measurements, including satellite data, with atmospheric chemical transport and urban-scale dispersion modelling. timescales. PM, which is one of the most health-relevant air pollutants, is associated with many health effects, such as all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and Stafoggia et al., 2013; Weinmayr et al., 2010). There have concentrations (PNCs), secondary organic PM, primary PM, metals, and toxic or hazardous pollutants. ponents has also stimulated further debate on the optimal concentration–response functions and on the necessity of (about 374 000 premature deaths) were linked to exposure PM 2:5exposure may have been considerably underestimated.

There is also evidence that is also becoming clearer, where dynamic diurnal activity pat- macher et al.

Correspondingly, integrated assessment activities for climate protection have started to include im- ergy and Industrial Strategy, have also recommended an inte- 2019).

This has been Some recent studies (e.g. Schmid et al., 2019) have provided evidence on the advantages of using costs and beneﬁts for grated assessments. fuel for ships has been reduced to 0.5 % worldwide (IMO, 2019). The EURO 6d norm has led to a signiﬁcant reduction Council has recently (in September 2020) agreed to reduce fossil fuels. However, there is one exception: small wood (e.g. Kukkonen et al., 2020b).

            "\n",
            "Here is a detailed breakdown of suitable monitoring techniques:\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Reference and Federal Equivalent Methods (FEM)\n",
            "\n",
            "These are the most accurate and scientifically rigorous techniques. They are used by government environmental agencies (like the EPA in the US) for regulatory compliance and official air quality reporting. They are expensive, require controlled environments, and are typically housed in permanent monitoring stations.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### a. Gravimetric (Filter-Based) Sampling\n",
            "*   **How it works:** This is the **gold standard** for PM2.5 measurement. Air is drawn through a size-selective inlet (a impactor or cyclone) that only allows particles smaller than 2.5 µm to pass through. These particles are collected on a pre-weighed filter over a specific period (usually 24 hours). The filter is then sent to a lab where it is weighed again under controlled temperature and humidity. The mass difference divided by the volume of air sampled gives the precise PM2.5 concentration (e.g., µg/m³).\n",
            "*   **Pros:**\n",
            "    *   Highest possible accuracy and precision.\n",
            "    *   Considered the definitive measurement against which all others are calibrated.\n",
            "    *   Provides a physical sample for further chemical analysis (e.g., to identify metals, sulfates, nitrates, or organic carbon).\n",
            "*   **Cons:**\n",
            "    *   Provides only an average concentration over the sampling period (no real-time data).\n",
            "    *   Very high cost for equipment, operation, and lab analysis.\n",
            "    *   Requires trained personnel and meticulous maintenance.\n",
            "    *   Not suitable for instant public information or hyper-local mapping.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### b. Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM)\n",
            "*   **How it works:** Air is drawn through a filter placed on the tip of a hollow, oscillating glass tube. As PM2.5 accumulates on the filter, the mass change causes a change in the tube's oscillation frequency. This frequency change is directly proportional to the mass on the filter, providing **near real-time** mass concentration data.\n",
            "*   **Pros:**\n",
            "    *   Provides continuous, hourly data.\n",
            "    *   Very accurate and designated as a Federal Equivalent Method (FEM).\n",
            "*   **Cons:**\n",
            "    *   Can be affected by the loss of semi-volatile compounds (e.g., ammonium nitrate) because the filter is heated to 50°C to remove moisture. This is often corrected for with a \"Filter Dynamics Measurement System (FDMS)\".\n",
            "    *   Still high-cost and requires regular maintenance.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### c. Beta Attenuation Monitor (BAM)\n",
            "*   **How it works:** This is one of the most common methods in regulatory networks. Air is drawn through a filter tape. A radioactive source (like Carbon-14) emits beta particles through the filter. A detector on the other side measures the intensity of the particles. As PM builds up on the filter, it attenuates (absorbs) more beta particles. The degree of attenuation is directly related to the mass of the particles.\n",
            "*   **Pros:**\n",
            "    *   Provides continuous, hourly data.\n",
            "    *   Robust and reliable, widely used as a FEM.\n",
            "    *   Generally less affected by volatile compounds than a standard TEOM.\n",
            "*   **Cons:**\n",
            "    *   Requires handling a radioactive source (with associated licensing and regulations).\n",
            "    *   High initial and operational cost.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Sensor-Based (Low-Cost) Methods\n",
            "\n",
            "These techniques have emerged more recently and use optical scattering principles. They are the core technology in consumer-grade and portable air quality sensors.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### a. Light Scattering (Nephelometry)\n",
            "*   **How it works:** A small fan draws air into a chamber where a light source (usually a laser or LED) illuminates the particles. A photodetector measures the intensity of the light scattered by the particles. The amount of scattering is correlated to the particle concentration in the air.\n",
            "*   **Pros:**\n",
            "    *   Provides **real-time, second-by-second data**.\n",
            "    *   Very low cost, small size, and low power consumption.\n",
            "    *   Enables dense sensor networks, mobile monitoring (on bikes, cars, drones), and personal exposure studies.\n",
            "*   **Cons:**\n",
            "    *   **Less accurate than reference methods.** The reading is influenced by particle size, composition, shape, and humidity (water droplets can scatter light like particles).\n",
            "    *   Must be calibrated against a reference method (like a gravimetric sampler) for the specific environment to improve accuracy.\n",
            "    *   Prone to drift over time and can be influenced by insects or dust entering the sensor chamber.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",

            "### 3. Emerging and Specialized Techniques\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Satellite Remote Sensing:** Satellites (e.g., NASA's MODIS and TEMPO) use aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements to estimate ground-level PM2.5 over large geographic areas. This is excellent for identifying regional pollution events and trends but lacks the precision and temporal resolution of ground-based monitors [1][2].\n",
            "*   **Mobile Monitoring Platforms:** Installing reference-grade or calibrated sensors on vehicles, drones, or bicycles to create high-resolution spatial maps of PM2.5 concentrations across a city. This helps identify pollution hotspots that fixed stations might miss. These platforms are part of efforts to develop high-resolution measurement networks using integrated measuring techniques [1][2].\n",
            "*   **Citizen Science & Dense Networks:** Using networks of hundreds or thousands of low-cost sensors to provide hyper-local air quality information to the public [4]. The key challenge is ensuring data quality through careful calibration and maintenance. Projects like those by the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany (luftdaten.info) demonstrate the practical application of this approach [4].\n",
            "*   **Integrated and Remote Sensing Techniques:** Advanced systems combine ground-based, aircraft-based, and space-based remote sensing to achieve three-dimensional coverage of observations, which is crucial for comprehensive air quality assessment and chemical transport model (CTM) evaluations [1][2][3].\n",

            "*   **For regulatory and official purposes:** **Reference Methods (Gravimetric, TEOM, BAM)** are the only suitable choice.\n",
            "*   **For scientific research:** A combination of a **reference method for ground-truthing** and a network of **well-calibrated optical sensors** for spatial analysis. This is supported by the development of integrated measuring techniques for high-resolution networks [1][2].\n",
            "*   **For community groups and citizen science:** **Calibrated low-cost optical sensors** are the most practical and effective tool, as demonstrated by ongoing projects [4]. The data can be very valuable if calibration and data quality protocols are followed.\n",
            "*   **For personal use:** Consumer-grade **low-cost sensors** are suitable for getting a general idea of air quality trends in your immediate environment (home, commute). It's important to understand their limitations and not treat the data as absolute truth.\n",
            "\n",
            "The choice of technique ultimately depends on the required **accuracy, temporal resolution, spatial coverage, and budget.** The most advanced monitoring systems often integrate data from multiple techniques (e.g., using reference stations to calibrate dense networks of low-cost sensors and incorporating satellite remote sensing for regional context [1][2]).\n",

            "1. **Class B CAZ**: This is the most common type, which restricts access to certain vehicles that do not meet the Euro 6 emissions standard (for diesel vehicles) or Euro 4 emissions standard (for petrol vehicles). Vehicles that do not meet these standards will be charged a daily fee to enter the zone.\n",
            "2. **Class C CAZ**: This type of CAZ restricts access to all non-compliant vehicles, including those that do not meet the Euro 6 emissions standard for diesel vehicles or Euro 4 emissions standard for petrol vehicles. In addition to the daily fee, these vehicles may also be subject to a higher charge or be banned from entering the zone.\n",
            "3. **Class D CAZ**: This type of CAZ restricts access to all vehicles, including those that meet the Euro 6 emissions standard for diesel vehicles or Euro 4 emissions standard for petrol vehicles. This type of CAZ is typically used in areas with severe air quality issues.\n",
            "4. **Low Emission Zone (LEZ)**: This type of CAZ is similar to a Class B CAZ but is typically smaller in size and has a more limited scope.\n",

            "1. **Designate the zone**: Identify the area where the CAZ will be implemented and define its boundaries.\n",
            "2. **Determine the type of CAZ**: Choose the type of CAZ that best suits the area's air quality needs.\n",
            "3. **Set the charging scheme**: Determine the daily fee or other charges for non-compliant vehicles.\n",
            "4. **Communicate with stakeholders**: Inform the public, businesses, and other stakeholders about the CAZ and its requirements.\n",
            "5. **Enforce the CAZ**: Install cameras and other technology to monitor and enforce the CAZ.\n",

            "2. **Class C CAZ**: This type of CAZ restricts vehicles that do not meet the Euro 6 or Euro 4 emissions standards, but allows vehicles that meet the Euro 5 emissions standard to enter without a charge.\n",
            "3. **Class B CAZ**: This type of CAZ restricts vehicles that do not meet the Euro 5 emissions standard, but allows vehicles that meet the Euro 4 emissions standard to enter without a charge.\n",

Several studies have investigated the relation- ship between perceived and measured outdoor air (Atari et al. 2009 ), others have found little or no rather than the advisory service, drove the response.Some epidemiological researchers have also indicated that self-reported health status is associated with et al. 2008 ).Information services Public awareness is fundamentally dependent upon optimal air pollution monitoring, forecasting and reporting. Many countries have air quality monitoringnetworks that are structured around a particular country’s regulatory obligation to report monitored lutants, air quality modelling systems and meteoro- logical data are also processed to create a national airquality index (AQI). Again in line with national legislation, an AQI communicates pollution levels and short term; Table 1). These data are used by the public Another information tool is provided by accessible air tion events via a computer/tablet (websites, email, social media) or phone (texts, apps) (London AirQuality Network; City of London). These are becom- ing increasingly informative and engaging, allowing example, providing low pollution journey planners to reduce exposure (Fig. 5).\n",
