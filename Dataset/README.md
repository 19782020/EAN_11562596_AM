The dataset used in this study includes 33 policy documents related to the environment and air quality, as well as 30 research papers on air pollution and its mitigation, totaling 63 documents. All original PDF format materials were uniformly converted into plain text for processing.

The policy documents are primarily sourced from official publications of the UK government and cover topics such as air quality standards (e.g., PM2.5 and NO₂ limits), the designation of Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs), classification and enforcement mechanisms of Clean Air Zones (CAZs), ammonia (NH₃) emission control, and emissions trading policies.

The research literature was collected from international journals, conference proceedings and environmental science databases, covering multiple regions around the world, including China, the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe. The research topics include the causes of air pollution, monitoring methods, health impact assessment and emission reduction strategy analysis, providing multi-regional and multi-perspective scientific support for policy-making.
